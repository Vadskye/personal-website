<h2>Whose Minions Are We Anyway?</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party explored the caves that had previously been inhabited by the Black Hand slavers, and which were currently inhabited by the crushed remnants of Black Hand slavers. They found some pretty sweet loot. They also found a hidden exit from the tunnels that led outside Griften, which they used to send off the slaves from Ssect so they could return home. Icera, the cleric of Chavi, agreed to tend to the Pelan slaves so they could be returned to their own homes. In gratitude for his assistance, Talbot gave Icera a large quantity of starmetal so he could potentially awaken Teralindel to defend his church if needed.

  With that complete, the party left Griften behind. In theory, they had agreed that they would go steal dragon eggs for Xavier, so they should have started travelling southeast to the ruins. In practice, consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, and they went straight north to reach the capital. After all, despite Clockwork's frequent vacations to the Ethereal Plane, he was still under a terrible curse that could potentially doom the kingdom.

  The party travelled for a span of days with little trouble except a particularly imperceptive group of bandits that tried to ambush them. It didn't last long. However, on the tenth day of their journey, the party was attacked by a large group of assassins. After a difficult fight, the assassins were defeated. They revealed that they had been sent by Zedar - months ago. They had been assassinating people doing the Rite of Maturity since then. Unsurprisingly, they were quite displeased to learn that Zedar had rescinded the bounty.

  Fortunately, the party knew exactly what to do with a group of assassins disgruntled with their former employer (who is probably evil): send them on a completely unrelated quest! The assassins were helpfully informed about Xavier and his desire for the dragon eggs. Burgen, the leader of the assassins, agreed that they would investigate this and, if they succeeded in retrieving the dragon eggs, would share the profits. With Silk, rather than the party. For some reason.
