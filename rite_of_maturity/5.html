<h2>Brought to You by the Mighty Hero Silk</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party waded through the goblins' ill-gotten gains and figured out which people got which shiny magic goodies. As they were on their way back to town, Deekin flew down from the sky riding a majestic hippogriff! He asked for the party's help in dealing with some magic-resistant creatures that had been bothering the hippogriffs. He was startled to learn of the attack on the town, and flew off to investigate with Krunch and Zanz in tow. When they arrived, they met with Captain Miles discovered that the town was safe - thanks to Silk! The night the goblins attacked, the town managed to fend them off for a few hours, but was still in danger. After just a few hours, Silk arrived with his band of reformed (?) assassins and slaughtered the goblins. Zanz and Krunch hurried back to the rest of the group to inform them.

<p>Meanwhile, the gnome sorcerer who had never revealed his name to the group and therefore went by the unofficial moniker of "Numnutz" wandered around on his own in search of a giant snake. When he found a tunnel, he went in with Reggie and discovered that the giant snake was oddly fond of giant spider webs. Undaunted, Numnutz walked bravely into the chamber, burning a path clear with magic fire so he could meet the giant snake which he was inexplicably certain resided in the tunnel. He was promptly ambushed, poisoned, paralyzed, and cocooned by a house-sized spider. The rest of the party mounted a rescue mission as soon as Krunch got back, and after a great battle, the party successfully retrieved the desiccated husk of a body that used to belong to Numnutz. Show up tonight to figure out what the party will do after their first casualty...</p>
