<h2>A Continuation of Gaming</h2>

<p>Last session, the group stayed the night at a farmhouse along their path towards the goblin mines. In the farmhouse, they discovered a dying worg which was trapped in a closed room for some reason. There was also secret door that led to a cellar full of delicious and probably illegal alcohol! Naturally, they imbibed... in a perfectly reasonable amount, due to a surplus of paranoia. The party also discovered a strange hole in the bottom of a pit in the cellar. They shined a light down in it and then decided it was not worth investigating further at the moment, so they went to sleep. Then in the night... goblins attacked! Show up to find out whether we managed to fight them off, or whether the entire party was slaughtered and used for goblin stew!</p>
