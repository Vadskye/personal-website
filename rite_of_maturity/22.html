<h2>Into Zedarkness</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party teleported into Zedar's tower. They arrived at the bottom floor, where they were surprised to encounter an equally surprised squad of assassins innocently practicing their murdering skills on training dummies. Unfortunately, this meant they were well equipped to deal with the party's sudden appearance, and they immediately attacked. Fortunately, the party was also well equipped to deal with the party's sudden appearance, and they retaliated effectively. After a quick flurry of fighting, Theodolus intimidated the assassins into reconsidering their life choices, and they decided to abandon the tower and their contract with Zedar rather than continue fighting.

  The party then took a brief rest to recover from the fight. When they were done, they wanted to try scouting out the tower, so Theodolus gave Clockwork the ability to fly. He zoomed around the tower and got a look at the third floor, but attracted the attention of a group of gargoyles in the process. He flew back to the party, and they barred the door. However, gargoyles are ten foot tall and made of stone, so the wooden door blocking the entrance was unlikely to present a significant obstacle. They scuffled with the gargoyles at the entrance, but it proved mostly ineffective all around, since the gargoyles were unable to get inside and the party couldn't do much to them while they stayed outside. Meanwhile, Zedar spoke with the party via magical intercom system, but the discussion proved mostly ineffective all around, since he refused to let the party ascend the tower and the party couldn't do much to him while they stayed downstairs. He was very upset that they brought Silk, though he wouldn't say why.

  To break the standoff, the party decided to escape to the second floor. They fled from the entrance, barricading the door with a conveniently placed training dummy, and all piled in to a narrow spiral staircase leading up. When they tried to open the door to the second floor, however, it went poorly. The stairs collapsed into a smooth ramp, the door at the top of the stairs refused to open, the door at the base of the stairs slammed shut, the bottom of the stairs opened up into a dark pit, and a loud rumbling sound began accelerating towards them. Krunch, Sir Patty Cakes, and Deekin slid down the stair/ramp and fell into the pit, landing a hundred and fifty feet down in a room filled with zombies. While they fought for their lives, the rest of the group tried to figure out how to avoid being crushed a large boulder in a narrow passage. They actually did rather well at that, leaping over the boulder and bracing against walls, thanks to a combination of magic, luck, and exceptional acrobatic skill. However, after the boulder passed by - and narrowly avoided crushing the half of the party in the pit - there was still nowhere to go above ground. The whole party descended into the pit, hoping to find some way to get back up into the tower to defeat Zedar. Show up this week to find out what lies in Zedar's underground lair!
