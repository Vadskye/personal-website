<h2>Attack of the Cultists</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party set out to meet Uther, the gnome cleric who worships a sentient ooze, Oozymandius<sup>1</sup>. Uther was, unsurprisingly, somewhat unhinged. However, he hates Zedar, and the party thought that he could make a potentially useful ally. Clockwork was interested in investigating the ooze, and found that the ooze reacted strangely to his body. Uther became excited, and invited Clockwork to join into holy union with the one true deity<sup>2</sup>. He eagerly accepted, and was consumed by the ooze. It held him suspended and unharmed, until he inexplicably<sup>3</sup> tried to inhale it, which went poorly. He avoided an unpleasant fate thanks to healing from Uther, and completed the ritual successfully. Clockwork's zeal to join with the ooze impressed Uther, and he offered Clockwork a boon. Despite the rest of the party pointing out the he could use the boon to have Uther and his ooze try to attack Zedar, he chose to be able to shoot acid from his hands. Which is also pretty cool.

  Seeing this, Talbot was encouraged to also try to convert to the worship of Oozymandius<sup>1</sup>. However, Uther demanded that he demonstrate his devotion by killing Astrius, the astral stalker. The party considered this. However, urged on by Krunch's desire to kill stuff, they decided to go wipe out the cult of Zedar to the south instead. They traveled through the tunnels until they reached a portcullis, where they were told to leave. Krunch and Sir Patty Cakes responded by raising the portcullis instead, and a fight broke out. The cultists fared poorly until they lured the party into their main champer, where an enormous pillow<sup>4</sup> was waiting. The party charged bravely in and defeated the cultists and their pillow. However, in the confusion, Theodolus went missing...

<p>
  Show up this week to find Theodolus - or his body!
</p>


<ol>
<li>Not its actual name.</li>

<li>Not actually the one true deity.<sup>5</sup></li>

<li>To be fair, he had a ring of water breathing. To be even more fair, it was a massive and possibly divine ooze, not a puddle of water.</li>

<li>Not actually a pillow. It was, in fact, a house-sized spider made of stone. However, some present did not like idea of house-sized spiders, so it was instead referred to as an unusually lethal pillow.</li>

<li>Probably.</li>
