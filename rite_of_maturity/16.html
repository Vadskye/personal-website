<h2>An Eggcelent Adventure</h2>

<p>
  Last session, the party decided that the best thing to do with their newly acquired heracore eggs was to make an omelette out of them. Sia foraged for seasonings and stealthily purchased an onion from a nearby farmer, and the party set to the task of disassembling the egg to acquire the tasty goodness inside. However, upon cracking open the egg, they realized that it contained a large heracore embryoo. Since no one felt like eating embryo omelettes, the noble quest was abandoned.

<p>The party then journeyed into Griften. After paying the gate tax to enter, they split up to search for a potential buyer for their eggs, and to go shopping. A couple of seedy bars - and a great deal of shopping - later, they found a potential buyer in Xavier, a man who deals with exotic animals. They met with him in a bar and negotiated a price with him. He also offered them an opportunity to acquire far more valuable eggs, for which he would pay dearly... red dragon eggs, guarded by their fearsome mother! Show up this week to help decide whether the group takes him up on his offer...</p>
