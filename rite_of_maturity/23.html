<h2>Putting the "Dungeons" in "Dungeons and Dragons"</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party began exploring the underground complex beneath Zedar's tower. They followed a maze of oddly twisting passages and found a locked door with strange creatures behind it, speaking a language no one knew. Fortunately, Rucks is <del>too dumb to realize that he can't speak that language</del> so enlightened that he can see into the true meaning of any communication, and he was able to understand them. He explained they intended to ambush and kill the party, which the party took some offense to. Silk, apparently, also felt this was undesirable, so he distracted the creatures by talking to them, unlocked the door, and signaled the party to attack, which they did with some enthusiasm<sup>1</sup>.

<p>
  Upon entering the room, the party found an astral stalker<sup>2</sup> leading a group of tiefling<sup>3</sup> warriors<sup>4</sup>. The party charged into battle. They defeated the tieflings without too much trouble, though Clockwork narrowly avoided significant injury from a poorly timed fireball. The astral stalker teleported around the battle, doing major damage with its claws, but it was forced to retreat when its allies were defeated. While the rest of the party stayed beyind to tend to the people the assassin had already wounded, Clockwork and Talbot chased the highly trained extraplanar assassin down dark hallways alone. It promptly ambushed them, injuring Talbot and dragging him off his horse. Fortunately, it was already significantly wounded, so they managed to force it to retreat again.

  The party rested in the room the assassin had occupied while they interrogated the tieflings. They discovered that the tieflings and the assassin, Astrius, had originally been hired to kill Zedar. However, Zedar had persuaded Astrius to work for him instead, which continued for two months until the whole group was thrown into the dungeon. They had been trapped down there for six months, living off of magically sanitized zombie flesh and their fellow trapped inhabitants. They were also able to provide a brief overview of what other creatures live down there - including a cult that apparently worships Zedar. Based on their information, the party set out to meet Uther, a gnome cleric who worships a living ooze. Show up this week to find out what else lurks in the deep!
