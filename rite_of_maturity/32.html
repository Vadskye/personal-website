<h2>Roll For (Metaphorical) Initiative</h2>

<p>
  Last session, the party collapsed the tunnel so the orcs couldn't chase them, and then delved deeper into the tunnels Silk had led them to. There, they had a committee meeting to discuss their plans. During the discussion, Oozymandias sent Clockwork a vision of what would happen if they assisted Tak and Kalak with their ritual. Apparently, their idea was to resurrect Gruumsh, the dead god of the orcs, and give him a fifty-foot tall physical form in the world. Once resurrected, Gruumsh would destroy Sephreina, the elf ruling the orcs, and hopefully scatter the Orclund to the four winds. Silk confirmed this was their plan, and that he had known it for some time.

  At this revelation, the party split into two diametrically opposed camps. Some, led by Clockwork and Krunch, were eager to help the orcs with their ritual. Some, led by Rucks, thought that resurrecting the evil god of the orcs would risk bring about an apocalypse<sup>1</sup>. After some heated discussion, in which Rucks and Atana attempted to leave the party rather than go with them to Tak and Kalak, the party agreed to try to stop Sephreina directly instead. The option of resurrecting Gruumsh for its own sake was left on the table as a backup plan for later.

<p>
  With that, Silk disguised the party as orcs and gave them all magic items which would allow them to speak and understand Orc<sup>2</sup>. They made their way out of the tunnels and into the center of the orc army where Sephreina and Faren waited for them. Show up this week for a heroic battle against the entire orc army!
