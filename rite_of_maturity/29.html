  Last session, Zedar attempted to monologue about his evil plan. The party paid him very little attention, and focused on rounding up various bodies and loot-related objects<sup>1</sup>. Undaunted by his total failure to be relevant, Zedar tried to warn the party about the evil plans of other people who had been hitherto unmentioned, but who were a dangerous threat to the party, the Pelan Empire, and possibly civilization itself. The party grudgingly paid some attention.

  Zedar explained that he had been working with the Orclund, the alliance of orcs with a massive army poised to crush civilization. He had been using Makor and the Spark to make an army of golems, which would join the Orclund's forces, and had been giving information to the Orclund through a telepathic link. More precisely, he had been sending information to a mysterious pale elf, dressed in white, who led the Orclund<sup>2</sup>. This elf had also been pivotal in Zedar's transformation into a lich, offering him the knowledge and materials necessary. With Zedar out of commission, the Orclund would be almost certain to begin their attack within weeks.

  The party decided that this was probably bad. It was, in fact, so bad that they agreed to let Zedar teleport them back to the capital so they could work on saving the kingdom as soon as possible<sup>3</sup>. They arrived back safely and immediately went to see the king, where Silk delivered a rousing speech about their heroic deeds, and how they had saved the kingdom<sup>4</sup>. The party received a handsome reward, and at the king's behest, all of the remaining signatures they needed from the nobles in the court. Silk also arranged for the king's blessing to go and finish the job with the Orclund, though he avoided revealing Zedar's connection to the Orclund.

  After that, the party hung around town, enjoying being out of Zedar's dungeon and around lots of fancy magic shops. Show up this week to rest on your laurels for about five minutes before you go save the kingdom<sup>5</sup>!

<li>Including Zedar's clothes, because they were magical and skeletons haven't got any bits to hide anyway.</li>

<li>In disguise, obviously. In the Orclund, your average mysterious pale elf dressed in white would have a life expectancy rivaled only by a snowball in the desert.</li>

<li>After a great deal of Sense Motive checks and attempts to divine the future.</li>

<li>Some of the things he said were even true.</li>

<li>Or ignore the whole plot and walk south from the capital until something interesting happens.</li>
