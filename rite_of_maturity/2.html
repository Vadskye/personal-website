<h2>A Continuation of Gaming</h2>

<p>
  Last session, the party decided to search around town briefly to see if they could find any evidence about the assassins. Thanks to Zanz' magical detection powers, they discovered that another bounty notice was hidden within the gutter of the fancy inn. After a strange combination of public urination, intimidation, destruction of public property, and the healing power of Mount Krakkle, they found the bounty notice and determined that the innkeeper had been unwillingly helping with the assassins. They also found fat stacks of cash.

  When this was brought to the attention of Miles, the captain of the guard, he gained a little respect for the party's competence (if not for their methods...). He directed them to a mysterious old ex-adventurer in town named Absalom, who took their fat stacks of cash and gave them all (suspiciously boring...?) magic items. Newly armed with cool stuff, the party decided to brave the goblin mines in search of loot, information, Silk, and opportunities for socially condoned murder, in no particular order.
