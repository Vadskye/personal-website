<h2>The Long-Awaited Return</h2>

<p>
  Last session, Krunch and Clockwork set out to speak with the orcs alone. They were ushered into the chieftan's tent, where their skills at diplomacy were put to the ultimate test by Tak, the chieftan, and Kalak, the head shaman. Krunch attempted to convince the orcs that he was the leader of the group, appointed by a powerful mage to seek the starmetal, and that the master's aims were similar to that of the orcs. Clockwork mostly attempted to convince the orcs that he was a buffoon. Meanwhile, the rest of the party was intensely debating whether or not to stage an armed rescue of the two prisoners, aided by Rucks's scouting to determine whether the two were actually in mortal danger.

  This tense standoff was resolved by the revelation of the orcs' ulterior motives. They were from one of the eight orc tribes comprising the Orclund, a powerful and unprecedented alliance of eight orc tribes. The Orclund is positioned to use its considerable might to attack and potentially annihilate the Pelan Empire. However, Tak and Kalak are trying to split up the Orclund. For unspecified reasons, they need the starmetal to accomplish this. After they told Krunch and Clockwork their story, Krunch requested to return to his group to discuss this revelation with them. They allowed this, though they insisted on keeping Clockwork as a prisoner to ensure that Krunch would return, knowing that he was loyal and would not risk leaving a friend behind.

  Krunch returned to the party, and after discussion, they decided to leave Clockwork behind.

  As they were leaving, Clockwork came running at his usual speed towards the party, explaining that he had escaped the orcs and stolen some starmetal and that the orcs were probably chasing him rapidly at that point (and they indeed were) so they should probably pick up the pace a bit to avoid a painful death. So they ran, and escaped the orcs. They started questioning Clockwork about the circumstances of his escape, and pieces of his story didn't quite make sense. Things got a bit confusing, and then a bit violent, culminating in the entire party nearly killing Clockwork as he unsuccessfully tried to escape. It became apparent that the orcs had placed a powerful spell on Clockwork which compels him to try to overthrow the Pelan Empire. Faced with this new problem, the party continued their attempt to leave the swamp. They initially kept Clockwork constantly bound, though that was quickly rescinded after an encounter with a dangerous swamp monster. They eventually made it out of Ssect and reported the orc situation to a guard captain at the border. They have starmetal in their possession, but are faced with villains elsewhere in the world, a potential villain as their employer (again), and perhaps even danger within the party. Only time will tell what the future will bring...
