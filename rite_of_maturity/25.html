<h2>Adventuring By Committee</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party noticed that Theodolus had gone missing<sup>1</sup>. They abandoned the corpses they were looting and raced after him. They chased his tracks back to the room with the tieflings, but there were too many exits to know which direction he went<sup>2</sup>, so they split up the gang to search for clues. The found a number of clues. Or more accurately, they found a number of large and potentially deadly monsters: giant dinosaur skeletons, a horde of zombies, snake people with human heads, minotaurs, a huge black dragon, an immense, animated pile of corpses, and a spider thing that shot webs at them behind a poisonous cloud. None of these things were Thedolus.

  The party reluctantly gave up searching and stayed in the tiefling room to rest. At this point, Theodolus wandered in. He explained that he had been kidnapped by Astrius, who had just wanted to have a private conversation with him. Astrius claimed to be willing to kill Zedar, but unable to directly act against him until the party dealt with the cult. As proof of this, he gave information about the cult, revealing that it was run by a powerful iron golem named Makor. Makor has the Spark - the ability to craft animated golems out of raw materials, without any complex rituals. If Makor is defeated without being destroyed, the Spark could be harvested from him, granting its power to someone else - such as the party. In response, Silk claimed that Astrius was actually still working with Zedar, and could not be trusted. According to Silk, Zedar uses the dungeon to store monsters so he can selectively release them against towns to lure Rite of Maturity questers to their doom.

  The party wrestled with the complexities of this information for a long time. Led by Clockwork, they organized a voting process, and after two rounds of voting, they all agreed to give up on figuring out what was going on and instead just go kill stuff. So they attacked the giant snakes with human heads, which went fairly well, and ended with a deal to get extra food for the tieflings. Show up this week to vote in a committee meeting about what to kill next!
