<h2>Into the Tunnels</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party started their journey towards Deekin and the hippogriffs in order to investigate the mysterious tunneling that was bothering the creatures. Along the way, they met a animalistic guardian of nature named Garruk, as well as his awesome wooden armor. He aided them in a fight against unusually aggressive giants who proved surprisingly flammable. (Did you know Zanz can make people's heads explode? Neither did they!)
</p>

<p>After dealing with the giants, the party climbed to the top of the plateau, where they met Deekin again and parted ways with Garruk. Deekin described what he knew about the tunneling, and the party decided to delve bravely in. Show up this week to find out what they discover...</p>
