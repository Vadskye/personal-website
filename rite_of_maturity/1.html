<h2>A Continuation of Gaming</h2>

<p>
  In the Pelan Empire, there is traditional rite of passage that all its inhabitants must undergo before they are accepted as full citizens of society: the Rite of Maturity. To complete this rite, you must travel the country, doing good deeds for people. Our characters (well, most of them) are trying to complete this rite - in our own haphazard way, naturally.

<p>So far, the main group has left Peloria, the capital city, and traveled south. Along the way, they became semi-voluntarily employed by a man of questionable moral character named Silk, and met a semi-sane wizard named Deekin. They arrived at Tannin, a town menaced by goblins, and semi-heroically fought and defeated the goblins. That night, the group was attacked by mysterious assassins, but managed to fight them off - only to discover that the assassins had a terrible, semi-world-shattering reason for targeting them!</p>
