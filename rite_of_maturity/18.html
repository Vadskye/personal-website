<h2>Slaver, No Slavering!</h2>

<p>
  Last session, the party travelled into the tunnels beneath the temple of Chavi, searching for sinister slavers to slay. They found two tunnels which appeared to be dead ends. They also found a bunch of bats, which formed a sinister shroud around a shadowy figure that stalked towards them. Deekin identified the figure as a Keeper - an enigmatic and dangerous being that has supernatural power over small animals such as bats. So the party killed it with fire.

  Seeing no further way to proceed on that level, the party took the elevator down to the bottom level. There, they encountered a talking rock named Teralindel that politely demanded metal, gems, or other delicious things that might conceivably taste good if you were a rock. In exchange, he offered to open up one of three sealed passages. Clockword donated some rubies, and Teralindel opened the north passage. The slavers loitering in that passage were somewhat taken aback by this development. Fortunately, their consternation was as short-lived as they were.

  Despite the party's best efforts, one of the slavers escaped and raced down the passage to warn the other slavers of the intrusion. Despite this warning, the slaver advance guard proved unable to significantly hinder the party's efforts - until they released huge, heavily armored war trolls. In the ensuing melee, Krunch and Sir Patty Cakes were both brutally attacked, and Sir Patty Cakes was dealt a grievous blow that removed several of his less important organs and left him within an inch of death. With the help of a bag of holding, Clockwork raced him back up to Icera, the cleric of Chavi, who narrowly managed to save Sir Patty Cake's life. After finishing off the trolls and rescuing a small number of slaves, the party took shelter in the church as they planned their next assault on the slavers. Show up this week to see what else lies in those dark tunnels!
