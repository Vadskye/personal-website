<h2>Now With 100% More Thursday</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party was joined by a fair-skinned elf named Clockwork who can run at obviously impossible speeds and who is definitely not racist towards non-elves at all. With their new ally, they attempted to delve into the tunnels beneath the hippogriff plateau. However, their efforts were thwarted by an arrow trap, a pit trap, poisoned spikes on the other side of the pit trap, a swinging blade trap, an acid-spewing trap, another pit trap, and giant monsters that crawled out of the depths to feast upon the living. Though the party survived, they discovered only two things for sure: pit traps are technically secret doors, and someone has way too much time on their hands.

  After venturing into the tunnel, the party retreated to the base of the plateau to rest. While camping there, they saw a trio of giants - one of whom was at least 25 feet tall (but definitely less than 40 feet, no matter what the DM tried to say) - approach the tunnel and converse with something in there. Seeing this, the party decided to spend the rest of the day stealthily following the giants around. Unfortunately, the giants eventually noticed they were being followed. A Benny Hill chase scene followed, as the supernaturally fast Clockwork led the giants away from the main group. Or... more accurately, he led the smaller giants away from the group before leading the largest giant directly towards the group. A dangerous fight followed, but thanks to a combination of setting the giant on fire, bewildering it, magically slowing its passage through time, freezing it, paralyzing it, hitting it with various sharp objects, and punching it really really hard in the balls, the monstrous creature was heroically slain.

<p>Show up this week to find out whether the party gives up on the whole tunnel business and wanders aimlessly south until something completely different happens!</p>
