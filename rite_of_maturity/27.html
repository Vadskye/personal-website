<h2>Necronaut Strong Enough</h2>

<p>
  Last session, the party beat a hasty retreat from the cultists of Zedar, in pursuit of the dragon's hoard<sup>1</sup> waiting for them. When they reached the door, they found that a powerful magical ward barred the door. Naturally, Sir Patty Cakes and Krunch responded by trying to smash it really hard until it broke. However, their destructive instincts were thwarted when a voice spoke up on the other side - Garruk had returned! He opened the door, and as the party started the arduous task of determining exactly how staggeringly wealthy they had just become, he told them that he had been taken as a prisoner by Zedar. With the dragon gone, he had taken the opportunity to break his chains, and was ready to accompany them to destroy Zedar.

  Garruk was somewhat taken aback to discover that the party had already defeat Zedar in combat. As the party related the story of their battle, it occurred to them that they should probably tell someone about the fact that they just saved the kingdom. They used the Sending stone Faren had given them to tell him that they had temporarily defeated Zedar, and he quickly teleported in. They explained what had happened, and he demanded that they open the Zedar bag - but it was empty. Zedar had managed to escape. Fortunately, Silk skillfully deflected Faren's anger at the narrow escape<sup>2</sup>. Faren then teleported back to his tower, saying he would use his magical powers to locate Xykonâ€™s Zedar's phylactery.

  Left to their own devices again, and slightly miffed by their encounter with Faren, the party decided to go break something. Since they were ethical adventurers, they decided to go break something that was probably evil, and attacked the necronaut<sup>3</sup>. It was a short and brutal fight, but they managed to put it down. Show up this week to join the fight against the Cult of Zedar!

<li>It is a well known fact that dragons hoard gold, jewels, and all manner of magical objects which adventurers find valuable. Most people don't worry too much about why this is the case. In general, the kind of person who would stop to wonder why a creature the size of a small castle needs a pair of life-draining gloves or a magical bugle is unlikely to spend much time in the presence of a dragon<sup>4</sup>.</li>

<li>Which didn't really make sense from the party's perspective, given that Zedar could have escaped even if the party had told Faren about it immediately. But the party's Sending had arrived right as Faren was in the middle of a good book arcane tome of great mystery and power, so he was in a bit of a grumpy mood.</li>

<li>Because a titanic mound of animated, screaming corpses is probably, but not necessarily, evil.</li>

<li>That is, alive in the presence of a dragon.</li>
