<h2>Curse Your Sudden but Inevitable Betrayal</h2>

<p>
  Last session, the party decided that the best way to figure out which people would betray them was to give them all the opportunity and see what would happen. To that end, they asked Faren to teleport them to Tak and Kalak, the orcs in the Forbidden Realm that are trying to sabotage the Orclund. Faren readily agreed to teleport them there personally.

<p>
  While he was preparing to teleport them, Clockwork and Krunch led the party on a journey to explore the rest of the mage's guild to find a gelatinous cube. They found a class in progress and took on the role of impromptu teaching assistants. Approximately one minute later, the class dissolved into mayhem and hat-pilfering. After fleeing the scene, they followed the trail of the ooze the office of the Bursar<sup>1</sup>. He was not an especially helpful<sup>2</sup> conversationalist, but the gelatinous cube was in his office, trapped within a magic circle. The party mounted a daring rescue of their oozy friend by sweeping away the magic circle with a conveniently located broom.

<p>
  However, before the party could make an equally daring escape<sup>3</sup>, they were interrupted by a loud voice demanding to know what they were doing with his Bursar. The voice came from a fairly well-built man with an unusually large pointy hat, who introduced himself as the Archchancellor. After some quick negotiation, the party was compelled to leave the university<sup>4</sup>, but they were allowed to keep the gelatinous cube.

  After leaving the guild, the party went to check on Silk with the gelatinous cube in tow. He confirmed that he was ready, and that the travelstone was trapped, so the party went back to Faren to begin the teleportation ritual. After casting a completely trustworthy buff spell on Clockwork, Faren completed the ritual and teleported the party... into the middle of an army of orcs<sup>5</sup>!
</p>


<p>
  A furious battle ensued. Muerdoc protected Deekin while he created prismatic walls to protect the party from being completely overwhelmed. Rucks and Atana worked together to bring down the orc leader<sup>6</sup>. Silk gave inspirational speeches which were supernaturally effective while his bodyguards took down orcs. Krunch, Clockwork, Marcus, and Sir Patty Cakes focused on dealing massive damage to Faren, which worked well until they noticed that Clockwork was taking half of Faren's damage. To solve that, they shoved Faren through a prismatic wall, which nearly killed Clockwork, and focused on Zedar instead. Under their combined assault, Zedar was reduced to a pile of bones. Faren threw a fireball through the prismatic wall, but this was more effective at clearing out the remaining orcs than at actually injuring the party. With their path clear, the party quickly made a plan to drop one of the prismatic walls and grab Faren, but he teleported away before they could rend him limb from limb. With a horde of orcs closing in, the party followed Silk into a hidden tunnel, where they plotted their next move. Show up this week to try to bring down the Orclund!

<ol>
<li>Person who manages the financial affairs of a university. Managing the financial affairs of hundreds of people who can warp the laws of reality on a whim requires a very special sort of mind, which explains a lot about the Bursar.</li>

<li>Or sane.</li>

<li>Presumably by walking away and hoping no one noticed anything was amiss.</li>

<li>The mage's guild contains a university somewhere within it. It is difficult to be more precise than that, because of the non-deterministic nature of space and time in areas of concentrated magic. The university usually occupies anywhere from one to four floors, though it avoids the top floor after one memorable incident when Faren awoke to find a Principles of Energetic Evocation class taking place in the middle of his personal library.</li>

<li>To the surprise of absolutely no one, except possibly the gelatinous cube.</li>

<li>The orc leader was easily identifiable because he shouted a lot and had the fanciest hat.</li>
