<h2>Now With Any Amount of Tuesday</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party tried to explore the second floor of the wizard's tower. They were confronted with a disembodied voice that demanded to know what they were doing in the tower. A flurry of more or less incoherent, sarcastic answers naturally followed. This was followed by the truth of why they were there, which was even worse. The disembodied voice who was probably the wizard quickly grew angry, and set a flurry of monsters on the party: a minotaur, four golems, and two skeleton archers. He also magically removed the exit, because it's a wizard's tower and he's an angry wizard.

<p>The party found themselves in a brutal battle. They managed to kill the minotaur - or rather, weakened it so a stray arrow from an incompetent skeleton archer killed it. They were faring well against the golems when the wizard himself appeared from a door the party hadn't explored, bristling with arcane power. After surviving a few spells, the party responded by shutting the door in his face so they could finish killing his minions. Stymied by this clever plan, the wizard retreated up to the higher levels of the tower, assuring them that they had no chance to survive if they followed. Show up this week to see if they will heed his warning and leave the tower alone forever!</p>
