<h2>It's a Swamp World After All</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party travelled south in search of the starmetal Zedar needs to construct mechanical engines of destruction. No, wait, I mean to construct adorable toys for children. They stopped at a small town called Terres on their way, where they immediately set about looking for sidequests. After rejecting several options for being too difficult, they discovered that the mercenary group that they fought against in Zedar's tower had moved south to Terres. The group had agreed to work for the mayor of that town instead, but there were lingering questions about the group's loyalties. The party resolved the situation by unequivocally vouching for the integrity of the mercenaries... though they did so without actually talking with them or seeing what they were up to. It got them signatures, though. Which is nice.

<p>The party then rapidly left the town in case they were wrong about the mercenaries, continuing south to the border of Ssect. They waded through the muck, trying to keep to high ground - or at least the less deep parts. However, they were beset by piranhas, which led them to stumble into the deep water inhabited by monstrous swamp-dwelling fish. Zanz and Clockwork were nearly eaten, but the party managed to save them with rope and also ninja-kicking a fish in the face. Join them this week as they press deeper into the swamp in search of the powerful starmetal...</p>
