<h2>A Conclusion of Gaming</h2>

<p>
  Last session, the party did glorious battle in the middle of the orc army to defeat Sephreina, the leader of the orcs. Muerdoc protected Deekin while he set up a field of prismatic walls to prevent the orc hordes from overrunning the party. Theodolus trapped Faren in a bubble of force to keep him from interfering with Krunch, Sir Patty Cakes, and Rucks as they demolished the orcs within the field. Atana and Clockwork went directly for Sephreina, and Atana delivered a brutal invisible sneak attack. Sephreina recovered almost immediately from the attack, however, and revealed that she was a spellwarped like Clockwork. She enticed him to join her side, which prompted a serious crisis of conscience.
</p>

<p>
  After much deliberation, Clockwork decided not to betray the party. Enraged, and with Deekin's prismatic walls blocking the rest of the orc army from view, Sephreina revealed her true power. She doubled in size and grew tentacles from her body to strike the entire party at once, dealing massive damage. Faren freed himself from Theodolus' bubble, but was promptly jumped on by Krunch. A contingent spell freed him from Krunch's assault, and he called in more orcs from outside the walls to aid him, but the whole party closed in on him and Sephreina. Without any remaining orcs to aid them, Sephreina and Faren were unable to stand before the combined assault of the entire party, and were paralyzed before they could escape. After some rapid deliberation, Krunch tore Faren apart with his bare hands, and Silk dealt the lethal blow to Sephreina, returning her to her original elven form. Victorious, the party collapsed the prismatic walls to show the orcs the true form of their would-be leader, dealing a fatal blow to the unity of the Orclund.
</p>

<p>
  In the chaos that followed, Krunch and Clockwork spontaneously created a new tribe of orcs: the Stronger Hand, with Krunch as its chieftain and Clockwork as his shaman. Krunch led them to spread the word about the end of the Orclund while the rest of the party returned to the capital to report their victory to the king. They were duly rewarded from the royal treasury, and promised that the great feast held to celebrate the end of the Rite of Maturity would also be in honor of their deeds.  At this point, the party went their separate ways.
</p>

<p>
  Silk became the king's close advisor and heir, and took over the throne in just a few years.
</p>

<p>
  Deekin went back to his monster-seeking travels, and eventually published his book, the Manual of Monsters.
</p>

<p>
  Krunch and Clockwork led their orc tribe in the worship of Oozymandias. They constructed a cubic temple to him in Peloria, which helped normalize orc/non-orc relations. Krunch also finally met his father and beat him in an arm-wrestling contest. Rumors say that Clockwork eventually found another elf of his own kind - perhaps even the one struck down by Silk, as her body was never recovered...
</p>

<p>
  Rucks became the abbot of a large monastery, and trained many pragmatic and slightly ill-tempered monks who went on to do a great deal of good.
</p>

<p>
  Sir Patty Cakes popularized the use of the Dwarven Really Big Hammer, and eventually found very good uses for his trapsmithing abilities. He also was properly knighted by King Silk, becoming Sir Sir Patty Cakes.
</p>

<p>
  Theodolus asserted his right to become Archmage of the mage's guild in Peloria by virtue of having defeated the previous archmage in a magical duel. However, this position was insufficient for his boundless ambition, and he eventually came into conflict with the king. This went poorly for him, and though the legends are vague on his exact fate, he was never seen in the Pelan Empire again...
</p>

<p>
  Atana went questing into the Outer Planes to discover more about her celestial ancestry, and met mighty angels and holy warriors. She may have picked some of their pockets, but only if they really deserved it.
</p>

<p>
  Muerdoc continued his wandering, traveling with Deekin for a time before joining Atana on her celestial adventures.
</p>

<p>
  Centuries later, their stories would pass into myth and legend... and they would join the hallowed ranks of the Rise pantheon, worshipped by future generations of variously well-intentioned adventurers!
