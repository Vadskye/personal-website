<h2>Lootsplosion!</h2>

<p>
  Last session, after surviving the goblin attack in the night, the party decided to investigate the tunnel below the pit in the cellar of the farmhouse within the long prepositional phrase. They sent Krunch down to investigate alone, who noticed about a dozen goblins in the tunnel! He returned to talk to the party before going down again to investigate alone. For some reason. But when he returned, there were no goblins in the tunnel... for they had gotten up into the cellar, and were currently leaping down to drive their pointy little goblin spears into his back!

  After a ferocious battle involving more dismemberment, terror, and body-slamming than was probably strictly necessary, the goblins were defeated. The party interrogated a surviving (and gibbering) goblin, the party learned that the goblins had started to attack the town last night! The signal to attack was apparently a light from the tunnel, which was certainly in no way related to the light the party shone into the tunnel while investigating it last night. Desperate to survive, the goblin told the party about a treasure hoard the goblins had left unguarded back at the mine. At this realization, the party broke into disagreement - should they go back and try to save the town, or press on and steal the goblins' treasure while they were all away? Krunch demanded that they save the town, and performed the most heroic neck-snapping of a helpless prisoner that history had yet recorded.

<p>The party then proceeded on towards the goblin mine. After a scuffle with hapless goblin scouts, they made their way into the depths and had a surprisingly civil conversation with a goblin shaman who warned them about a mysterious cloaked figure that had been responsible for the tunnel. He/she/it/they had been controlling the goblins and compelling them to attack the town, and the shaman was tired of it. With the shaman's help, the party negotiated a deal that would save the town, burn down the goblin mine, and - most importantly - get them the sweet loot from the hoard. They also got a goblin shaman hat which looks totally rad. Show up to find out what the hapless horde's hefty hoard held!</p>
