<h2>Putting the "Dragons" in "Dungeons and Dragons"</h2>


<p>
  Last session, the party decided to explore the northern passage into the dungeon, past the mysterious spider mage thing. They stopped briefly at the same magical trap that they had encountered before, and bantered with the spider mage thing which was attempting to lure them into the trap. However, the party was having none of it, and their casual threats of gruesome death made the spider mage thing reconsider its life choices. Instead of unleashing its legion of poisonous spider children on the party, which would probably have been a great battle sequence, it ran off down the corridor and hid.

  However, when the party continued down the tunnel, there was a great rumbling, like the sound of dreams of a peaceful session collapsing. The tunnel ahead was blocked by falling rocks. As the party turned to gbiteo back, a cloaked skeleton appeared, cackling and glowing with dark power, and riding a massive dragon that was just barely able to squeeze into the corridor.

  At this point, there was a general milling about in confusion and fear. Half of the party tried to attack the dragon, half tried to run off towards the collapsed tunnel in the hopes of finding an escape route, and Clockwork jumped onto the dragon's back to fight it from behind. The dragon's corrosive breath and powerful bite, accompanied by Zedar's the mysterious skeletal mage's spells, made fighting head-on immensely dangerous, though Deekin erected a powerful wall which helped shield the party. While Talbot created a dangerous plan with Silk involving sneaking around and doing something stupid with a Bag of Holding, Sia (finally!) found a secret door, which the party eagerly threw open. On the other side, they found a massive room with ballistas, a small army of cultists, and a huge iron golem. As the ballistas swung around and the cultists charged furiously, they apologized and closed the door.

  As the dragon closed in on the party, Talbot held the front line while Clockwork duelled Zedar on the dragon's back. When Zedar seemed to be struggling, Astrius teleported in and backstabbed Clockwork. However, with Zedar focused on killing Clockwork, Silk appeared out of nowhere and threw Zedar into the Talbot's Bag of Holding. Without Zedar, Astrius teleported away immediately, and the dragon was forced to retreat under the party's combined assault. Desparate, it caught Talbot in its jaws and tried to bargain for its life. However, negotiations went poorly, and Talbot was turned into a vaguely Talbot-shaped puddle of goo before the party killed the dragon in vengeful retribution. With the cult breaking through the secret door in pursuit, the party was forced to hastily retreat past the dragon's corpse, unable to give Talbot a proper burial, or even to retrieve more his magic items and a reasonably sized chunk of his torso. Show up this week to experience life without Talbot, figure out what to do with a bag full of Zedar mysterious skeleton mage, and loot the dragon's hoard...
