<h2>Exposition Time!</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party teleported back to Kilrein, the capital of Kilvas. They found themselves in a dark stone room underground. By a heavy iron door, a sign was hung, telling them to wait for Winston to come get them. The party considered this for a few seconds before Antimony, Lorelei, and Lord Khallus worked together to bash the door down<sup>1</sup>. Outside, the party found a narrow hallway that held two terrified guards, who explained that they were underneath one of Kilrein's jails. The party argued for a while about whether to leave immediately or to wait for Winston - an argument that quickly blossomed to encompass larger questions like "what should we do about this Book of Creation thing" and "who is this Winston fellow anyway". They also renamed one of their guards Terry, and coerced him into joining the party for good measure.
</p>


<p>
  After observing the party for some time as they argued, a cloaked figure emerged from the shadows of the stairwell leading to the surface. He approached the party and introduced himself as Winston. Despite some initial misgivings, the party allowed him to approach and began questioning him about the Book of Creation, Torvid, and anything else that came to mind.
</p>


<p>
  Winston explained<sup>2</sup> that the knowledge of how to the curse on the Book of Creation could be found in the ruins of the Temple of Truth<sup>3</sup>. Unfortunately, those ruins are located on the coastline of the Moravian Empire, rendering them difficult to access. Winston speculated that, if the party did find out how to remove the curse, it would reveal the Moravian Empire as being evil and cause the world to unite against them.
</p>


<p>
  Removing the curse would likely have other effects as well. According to Winston, ancient maps indicate that the world was once significantly larger than its current size, and the Edge of the World<sup>4</sup> was much more distant than it is now. Removing the curse might reveal long-forgotten lands beyond the Edge of the World, which would hopefully provide allies in the fight against the Moravian Empire.
</p>


<p>
  Winston also explained the current political situation in Kilrein. Reletharian, the elven king of Kilvas, was preparing to cede control of the northern half of the island to Torvid's forces in exchange for peace. Meanwhile, the Moravian Empire was apparently at war with the dragons, but no one was sure exactly why.
</p>


<p>
  The party considered this, and decided to split up. Most of the party would travel to Galia<sup>5</sup>, where they would try to convince Galia's ruling council to send military support to Kilvas. That group would then travel to find the dragons in the Spine of the World<sup>6</sup>, where they would essentially try to do the same thing. The rest of the party would try to find Jed to help him slow down Torvid's forces as they advanced on Kilvas<sup>7</sup>. Meanwhile, Winston would recruit a crew in Kilrein that would sail to the Temple of Truth. Once the party was ready, they would all teleport to that ship and search for a way to fix the Book in the Temple of Truth.

<p>
  After going through this entire process, the party celebrated its conclusion by traveling to a warehouse and beating up some evil pirates.

  Show up this week to enjoy elven politics!

<ol>
  <li>The only reason it took three people was that the door was magically sealed shut. An ordinary iron door would be no match for anyone in the party. Except maybe Tiberius.</li>

  <li>In a somewhat disjointed fashion, filled with many interruptions from impatient listeners and punctuated by the occasional flying axe.</li>

  <li>For many centuries, the Temple of Truth was the greatest library in the world. This changed a few hundred years ago when orcs from Kilvas raided it and burned it to the ground.</li>

  <li>The Edge of the World is an impassable misty barrier that surrounds the known world. Nothing has gone beyond that barrier and returned.</li>

  <li>Galia is a large country on the main continent. It is ruled and primarily populated by by elves.</li>

  <li>The Spine of the World is a huge mountain range on the main continent. It separates Galia from the Moravian Empire.</li>

  <li>Somewhat confusingly, Kilvas is both the name of the country founded after the Orc War of Extermination, and also the name of the island that country is on. One of the most important reasons to stop Torvid is to make sure that future historians don't have to worry about distinguishing between those two things.</li>
