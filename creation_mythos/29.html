<h2>The End</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party was in a standoff with the demon lord after performing the ritual to restore the Book of Creation. It demanded that they use its power to fuel the Ritual of Control, that would allow them to use the power of the Book of Creation to make their own alterations to reality. The party had no interest in granting that influence to a demon lord. The demon angrily threatened them with the army of fearsome creatures that it controlled, and revealed that it was Demogorgon, the Prince of Demons<sup>1</sup>. However, as its army to enter the Seed Crater to attack the party, <b>Kahl</b>'s power repelled the army<sup>2</sup>. With its overwhelming advantage nullified, Demogorgon assumed its true form and entered the crater to deal with the party personally, accompanied by two bebeliths hidden among the army<sup>3</sup>.
</p>


<p>
  A terrible battle ensued, as the party struggled to hold their own against Demogorgon's dual onslaught of physical prowess and incredible magical power. Antimony angered it with a spell that made it bleed, and it retaliated by ripping her limb from limb and absorbing her body into its form. However, her death released an explosion of power from <b>Kahl</b>, injuring the demons. This explosion was soon repeated when Wanderlost fell in turn to the demon's onslaught. In desperation, the party coordinated more effectively than ever before, trying to keep as many people alive as possible while bringing down the two bebeliths before focusing their full attention on Demogorgon.
</p>


<p>
  Devoid of allies, weakened by <b>Kahl</b>'s influence and the fragmentation of its power, and crippled by the combined assault of the entire party, Demogorgon was finally killed by Lord Khallus. <b>Kahl</b>'s power immediately consumed its body<sup>4</sup>, purifying his crater. Without the demon's influence, the horde of creatures around the perimeter of the crater dissolved into chaos, and the party fended off some of the more aggressive creatures that ventured into the crater. Eventually, the creatures dispersed, and the party began the Ritual of Control using <b>Kahl</b>'s power.
</p>


<p>
  A great deal of discussion and ethical dilemmas followed, and Lorelai revealed that he was not truly Lorelai - he was a changeling<sup>5</sup>, not an elf, and his true name was Celeano. Against all expectation, the party was completely unfazed by this revelation. <b>Kahl</b> made an appearance, and told the party he was proud of what they had accomplished. In the end, the party made the following revisions to the fabric of reality:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Resurrect Antimony and Wanderlost</li>

  <li>Bring Antimony and Wanderlost into the Ritual of Control</li>

  <li>Summon an avatar of <b>Kahl</b>, so the party can converse with him and allow him to give his input on the ritual</li>

  <li>Banish Demogorgon from the Material Plane, ensuring that it can never return. This also removed the demonic power granted to the Moravians.</li>

  <li>Restore Reignau's draconic form</li>

  <li>Restore Maxwell's standing as a paladin of good</li>

  <li>Resurrect Amanita's parents, who were killed by Moravians</li>

  <li>Record the party's journey in the Book of Creation, thus making these emails canon in-universe (with some light editing to avoid fourth-wall breaks)</li>

  <li>Grant Celeano knowledge of the identity and status of master's killer</li>

  <li>Give everyone in the party a million gold</li>

  <li>Grant Wanderlost the knowledge of where her lost tribe is</li>

  <li>Finish the ritual, preventing any future changes</li>
</ul>

  <p>
    When the ritual finished, <b>Kahl</b> bid the party a fond farewell. He also told them that he was making a new world, and that the party was welcome to visit when he finished<sup>6</sup>. An avatar of Bahamut appeared as well, and thanked the party for restoring Elysium.
  </p>


<p>
  With that, the party returned to Kilvas to enjoy their newfound success. They worked together to save Jed from Eyeblight's influence, and the king of Kilvas fulfilled his promise to make the party the heroes of the new and improved Fish Festival. Lord Khallus rebuilt Lagonton, and officially renamed it to Fubar with his new power as the Lord of Northern Kilvas. Most of the party split up to go their separate ways, though a smaller group stayed together to hunt down the assassin who killed Celeano's master. But those are tales for another time...
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The title is not merely self-appointed; demons and angels alike acknowledged Demogorgon as the Prince of Demons, which hints at the power he wields in its full form. He disappeared from the Abyss eons ago, but even in its long absence, no demon claimed its title. Or, more accurately, no demon has claimed its title and survived longer than a day.</li>

  <li>Surprisingly, <b>Kahl</b>'s power also repelled Hek, who was secretly controlled by the demon after she ate the rotten fish when the party first travelled beyond the Edge of the World.</li>

  <li>A bebelith is a house-sized demon spider. That's really all that needs to be said about them.</li>

  <li>Much to the dismay of Amanita.</li>

  <li>A changeling is a magical creature that has the ability to alter its physical appearance at will.</li>

  <li><b>Kahl</b>'s new world is different in several ways from the world the party has come to know. For one thing, he created the dwarves first.</li>
