<h2>Congratulations You Did The Thing</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party teleported into Reggie's study room in Kaliatori, the capital of Galia. As the party determined that they were, in fact, still alive, Reggie called them over to the window. Hundreds of miles away, near the top of one of the mountain peaks being buffeted by the immense storm, they could barely make out a massive fireball denoting their success. The party agreed to go talk to the Chamber of Elf-Lords to take credit - but not until after collapsing into inn beds to rest the night, with not even a drunken tavern party to celebrate their success.

  The next day, the party traveled to the Chamber of Elf-Lords to get their aid. In the waiting room, they met none other than the long-absent Amanita and Reignau! They had been working with Jed to wage a guerilla war against Torvid to slow his advance on civilization, but Winston recalled them in the wake of a lost battle against Torvid to come help the party in Galia. They had been making slow progress convincing the Chamber to help. Fortunately, the party had just performed a great service for Galia, and with the party now united, they asked to present their case to the Chamber. When they did, Saul appeared from within the Chamber chambers, and led them back to a private room.

  The party told Saul that they had just saved Kaliatori from destruction by the Moravians, and he listened intently. When they had finished, he congratulated them, and asked a nearby closet what it thought of the party's efforts. In response, the closet opened and revealed Nathaniel, the Elf-Lord who had been assassinated by Nosferatu. Nathaniel explained that Nosferatu had returned him to life and sent him back to the party as a gesture of good faith, bearing a message: "He wants to talk to you. He said you'd know where." The party was deeply suspicious, but decided to go back to the inn where they had originally planned to ambush Nosferatu.

  Before that, however, the party had to present their case to the Chamber. Nathaniel intended to do the talking for the party, but Lord Khallus offered to contribute his efforts as well. Despite the varying degrees of horror the party expressed at having Lord Khallus be their official representative, Nathaniel agreed that Lord Khallus would do well, and they set off to the Chamber. After being introduced as the leader of the party, Lord Khallus took the stage alone in front of hundreds of highly revered and immensely powerful Elf-Lords. Despite some initial stumbles, his speech was a riveting and emotionally compelling success, and the Chamber gave him a standing ovation. They agreed to send Galian forces to aid Kilvas, and to handsomely reward the party for their efforts. The party celebrated their success with a shopping spree in one of the largest cities in the world.
