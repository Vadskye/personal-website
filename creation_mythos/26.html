<h2>Rise - And Fall (of Torvid)</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party teleported into Torvid's treasure room<sup>1</sup>. Nosferatu and Hak stealthily assassinated the various troll guards that blocked their way out, and they reached the surface without major incident. As planned, Nosferatu created a distraction, drawing Torvid's guards away so the party could attack Torvid. The party ran out when Nosferatu's distraction began and found Torvid - a towering, twenty foot tall war troll<sup>2</sup> clad in finely crafted adamantine armor, wielding a fifteen foot long adamantine greatsword. He was flanked by two mech trolls and speaking with a human shaman.

  Undaunted, the party charged into battle. They executed the unusual tactical maneuver of sacrificing their entire front line to gang up on the shaman, killing him before he could cast any of his devastating and really awesome spells that would have made the fight much more difficult. However, this allowed Torvid to dive into their back line of casters, and he attacked in a flurry, nearly killing Antimony. The fighters quickly returned, and Lord Khallus and Maxwell managed to goad Torvid into attacking Maxwell while Antimony escaped. Under the party's combined assault, Torvid was forced to retreat, but was brought down before he could make it back to his approaching guards.

  When Torvid fell, the party prepared to retreat from the mech troll guards. However, Torvid's armor floated into the air on its own, disregarding Torvid's increasingly dismembered body, and began attacking. With little time to spare, Lorelei temporarily disabled the armor's magic, allowing the party to throw it into a bag of holding and make a quick escape with another one of Reggie's teleportation stones.
