<h2>Banished To The Shadow Realm</h2>

<p>
  Several weeks ago, the party walked through a planar portal to reach the Shadow City<sup>1</sup>. They met a guard outside the gates who quickly determined that they were hopelessly ignorant, and told them to just go through a nearby portal to the Market District and ignore the rest of the city. Despite some misgivings, he eventually opened the gates to let them in. Once inside, the party saw a dizzying array of gravity-defying and, occasionally, questionably Euclidean architecture flanking a huge street that led into the depths of the city. Overhead, the infinite gray void of sky loomed ominously. The party quickly followed their instructions and went into a nearby portal that led to the Market District, which featured much more ordinary buildings and a reassuring blue sky overhead, complete with a false sun<sup>2</sup>.

  Once inside, the party split up to spend their newly acquired wealth, and soon liberated the city of several shiny magical items. Their mission accomplished, the party deferred to narrative tropes and spent the rest of the evening at a bar<sup>3</sup>. At the end of the evening, they all found places to sleep in the inn.

  Join us this week to find out why the session ended before the party woke up!

  <li>The Shadow City is not the only city in the Shadow Plane, nor even the largest. It is, however, the most tourist-friendly, so it has acquired a name understandable to people from all planes of existence. Its true name is pronounced Narshakulus, if you're into that sort of thing.</li>

  <li>The sun was a massive, fast-moving orb of harmless light created by an arcane ritual, which is clearly fake. A proper sun is a massive, fast-moving orb of harmless light created by divine power at the dawn of time.</li>

  <li>Amanita also discovered an interesting establishment named the Nether Regions, and he did not speak of what transpired there.</li>
