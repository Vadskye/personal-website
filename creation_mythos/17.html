<h2>We Actually Fought Something For Once</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party prepared to ambush Nosferatu in Nathaniel's house. Lorelei was disguised as Nathaniel, and the rest of the party took up positions around the house to keep watch. In the dead of night, an assassin tried to break in through the window. Before he could attack "Nathaniel", however, he triggered a magical trap that Antimony had planted, allowing Antimony and Lorelei to blast him with spells. With the element of surprise lost, the assassin fled out the window and summoned a group of fellow ruffians to aid him. The party quickly set upon the rogues outside Nathaniel's house.

  After a short fight, the party knocked the lead assassin unconscious, while the assassins simultaneously brought Lord Khallus to the brink of death. To save their leader<sup>1</sup> the assassins surrendered, allowing both sides to treat their wounded. With the entire party working together to save him, Lord Khallus barely survived, and the interrogation began.

<p>
  The interrogation proved remarkably short-lived<sup>2</sup>, and the assassins revealed that their leader was not Nosferatu. In fact, they were a completely separate group of assassins. They were hired to kill Nathaniel by a rival Elf-Lord named Marithane, and did not seem to have any knowledge that Nathaniel had already been attacked by Nosferatu. The party sent a Sending<sup>3</sup> to Saul, who left a burglary he was investigating and brought a group of guards to arrest the assassins. After sending them away in chains, the party thought they were safe, and their job well done.

<p>
  The next morning, Saul informed told the party that Nathaniel had been killed<sup>4</sup>, and his body stolen. Nosferatu had succeeded while the party was distracted - and Saul suggested that he would probably have interrogated Nathaniel before he died, which meant that Nosferatu would probably know that the party had the Book. Faced with this news, the party decided to give up on the entire process of pleading their case to the Chamber of Elf-Lords. Instead, they would head directly to the Spine of the World to seek aid from the dragons.

  <li>The party has grown remarkably intimidating, especially to people who haven't known them long enough to find them amusing.</li>

  <li>A ritual that magically sends a message across any distance or plane to its intended recipient. It was useful to avoid jogging a short distance through the city to Saul's guardhouse.</li>
