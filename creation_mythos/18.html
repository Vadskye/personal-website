<h2>Into the Spine of the World</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party teleported into the Spine of the World. When they arrived, they were immediately ambushed by a strange group of half-naked<sup>1</sup> men covered in arcane sigils. They attacked the party in a flurry of flaming fists, magically made missiles, and generally gratuitous grappling. The party responded by killing all but one of them.

  Interrogation revealed their prisoner, named "39", was remarkably pliable<sup>2</sup>. He was from the Moravian Empire, and was a soldier in their war with the dragons. He said there were about 20,000 Moravian troops fighting the dragons, split into about 200 different numbered "groups". They had seized the teleport rooms on the outskirts of the most populous draconic area three days ago. Reggie said the closest entrance to that central area was four hours away, so the party prepared to set off after a quick rest. While the party was resting, they were inspected by another Moravian, who they quickly took prisoner. This prisoner proved similarly personality-less, but offered no useful new information. After resting, the party set off<sup>3</sup>.

  At the end of the long tunnel, the party found a huge, vibrantly blue wall of ice. It was clearly magical, and radiated intense cold. Undaunted, Antimony went up to the wall and knocked. A booming voice from the other side announced that the party would not be allowed entrance, for it could sense Moravians with them. When the party protested that the Moravians were merely prisoners, the voice stated that they must kill their prisoners and formally denounce the Moravian Empire<sup>4</sup>. The party readily complied. At this, the wall shattered, and a towering white<sup>5</sup> dragon declared that the party was now its prisoner.

  Show up this week to get eaten by a dragon<sup>6</sup>!
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fortunately, the half from the waist up.</li>

  <li>In fact, he almost entirely lacked a personality of any kind.</li>

  <li>Accompanied by five friendly skeletons that Antimony animated.</li>

  <li>And the "principles of Morav", whatever those were.</li>

  <li>It is important to note that white dragons tend towards the southern end of the alignment spectrum. But then again, so do people who go around killing helpless prisoners...</li>

  <li>Maybe.</li>
