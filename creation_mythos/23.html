<h2>Now With 100% More Explosions</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party remembered that Pabst had actually found another prisoner in the Moravian jail when he escaped. The prisoner was a seven foot tall goliath<sup>1</sup> named Wanderlost, and Pabst freed her when he escaped. After remembering this, the party ran into the stairs that led to the Leviathan Cannon. They quickly barred the door against the Moravians pursuing them, and Lorelei and Wanderlost held the door closed while Reggie quickly performed a ritual to seal the door. With the path behind them sealed, the party descended the stairs in search of the Cannon.

<p>
  When the party reached the bottom of the stairs, they found a small group of Moravian guards, which they quickly dispatched. They rested for a quick minute, but heard Moravians on the other side fortifying their defenses against the party, and decided not to wait any longer. They kicked down the door<sup>2</sup> and found a squad of about fifteen Moravians, including two mech trolls, standing on a balcony. Beyond the balcony, an immense metal machine loomed, serviced by hundreds of Moravians on a floor a hundred feet below the balcony.

<p>
  A huge fight broke out, with Maxwell charging forward deep into the enemy lines to deal with the casters while the rest of the party held around the entrance. Maxwell launched one of the mech trolls off the balcony, dispatching it effortlessly, while surviving a brutal barrage of attacks thanks to magical aid from Lorelei and Mortin. Wanderlost charged fiercely into the fight, dealing significant damage, but quickly discovered why civilized people tend to wear more clothing in battle when she nearly died twice. However, several bursts of healing from Mortin kept her in the fight. Pabst, his lion, and Lord Khallus held the front line at the door while Lorelei, Antimony, and Reggie<sup>3</sup> unleashed magical destruction on the Moravians<sup>4</sup>.

<p>
  Then the Leviathan Cannon fired. The the blast sent a massive shockwave through the room, dealing significant damage to everyone, deafening most of the party, and destroying an entire wall of the fortress. Outside, the storm continued, though its strength was significantly reduced from when the party last saw it. Undaunted, the party continued their attack. When the Moravians were all weakened, Lord Khallus cleaved through half a dozen Moravians in a single rapid flurry of halberd strikes, essentially ending the fight. When the battle was nearly over, Lorelei launched himself into the air over the Cannon, gliding through the air on draconic wings in search of a control mechanism. He quickly saw a group of three Moravians manipulating a strange control panel, and glided<sup>5</sup> towards them. He fired a series of lightning balls at them, causing the control panel to spark worryingly, and they returned fire with jets of fire. The rest of the party sprinted towards the control panel, with Maxwell arriving first. However, before they could kill the Moravians, they sabotaged the control panel to prevent the party from stopping the Cannon from firing.
</p>


<p>
  Fortunately, the Moravians underestimated the party's ingenuity. Lorelei set to work trying to understand the complex mechanisms of the control panel, and identified controls which should be able to alter the cannon's aim, preventing it from hitting Kaliatori. While he worked on that, Mortin's attunement to Destruction granted him a vision of inspiration from his deity, suggesting that he try to destroy the big red Fire button. He and Lord Khallus unleashed a destructive onslaught on the button, destroying it and much of the metal around it. That impact combined with Lorelei's tinkering and electrical short-circuiting to jolt the cannon into motion, throwing off its aim. However, that wasn't all - it also set off a chain reaction in the cannon, jump-starting its firing sequence without the normal safety measures. The party realized that the cannon was going to fire, and they wouldn't have much time to escape. However, Reggie pulled out another teleportation stone and told the party to quickly attune to it. As the explosion from the Cannon raced towards the party, Reggie threw the stone at the Cannon, destroying it and whisking the party away moments before they would have been incinerated.

  Show up this week to take credit for saving the capital of Galia!

<ol>
  <li>A goliath is a massive mountain-dwelling humanoid creature. They and are known for being extraordinarily strong, and for their propensity for wearing minimal clothing to display their tribal markings.</li>

  <li>Which is a delightful trope which has been sadly rare in recent times.</li>

  <li>When, uh, he remembered to take any actions at all.</li>

  <li>Also, Lorelei turned one of them into a girl. No one seems sure why, including Lorelei.</li>

  <li>"Glided" sounds strange. "Glode"? No, that's not right at all...</li>
