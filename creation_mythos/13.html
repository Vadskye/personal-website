<h2>Welcome Back to the Material Plane, Again</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party left the Hall of Champions to return to the Material Plane<sup>1</sup>. When they climbed out of the hole leading to the Hall of Champions, they found a group of Torvid's horses rushing into the building, trying to attack them. Fortunately, his horses consisted of a swarm of goblins crammed into tight corridors, and the goblins were quickly burned, shocked, frozen, bowled over, and generally obliterated by the party's combined powers.
</p>


<p>
  The party wasted no time in trampling over the corpses of the goblins to reach a larger and more powerful horse of hobgoblins waiting outside the building. However, the hobgoblins seemed oddly ill and weaker in combat, and the party swiftly prevailed in another flurry of magical energy and dragon claws<sup>2</sup>. The party left two prisoners alive<sup>3</sup>, and began interrogating them to learn about Torvid's horses and plans. Unfortunately, the prisoners proved as generally useless and ignorant as the other warriors the party had asked.
</p>


<p>
  During the interrogation, a mysterious goblin, concealed by the bodies of its fallen comrades, picked Lord Khallus's pocket<sup>4</sup>. It remained hidden for some time, but Amanita's magical composting of the corpses removed its cover, threatening to reveal it. At an opportune moment, the goblins stepped out and revealed itself, speaking boldly in Common. The party, along with Jed and his warriors, immediately brought a variety of pointy sticks of varying size and shape to bear on the intruder. Unconcerned, it introduced itself as Ktharckz, and said it was a spy working for Winston. At Jed's prompting, it revealed that it had poisoned the hobgoblins before the fight. The party deliberated, and eventually came to the conclusion that they would trust the goblin for the time being.
</p>


<p>
  After resolving not to kill the goblin, the party split up. Antimony and Lorelei set off to investigate nodes of magical power that they sensed outside the town, while the rest of the party searched for the mage that brought Jed and his warriors to Foobar. Jed briefly interrogated the goblin in private and proclaimed his unqualified trust in it upon his return, and the party allowed the goblin to join their search. This proved fortuitous when the goblin walked into a brewery<sup>5</sup> and was immediately attacked by magic missiles conjured by a scared-sounding human voice. Amanita rushed to the goblin's aid and healed it, causing the scared-sounding human voice to express confusion that a human would heal a goblin. The situation was explained, and Jed shouted for "Reggie" to come out. Reggie turned out to be a young human mage who had escaped the hobgoblins unharmed by hiding in the brewery.
</p>


<p>
  With Reggie found, Jed announced that his time with the party was done. With the Book of Creation in the hands of the party, Torvid had no more need for subtlety, and would soon send his full horses marching south to recover it. Jed said he would travel north alone to slow down the armies, hoping to buy time for the party to figure out what to do with the Book. He charged them simply to use the time he gave them wisely, and ran off.
</p>


<p>
  When Jed left, Reggie offered to teleport the party wherever they wanted to go<sup>6</sup>. After some deliberation, the party decided to go back to the capital. Reggie began the process of teleporting the party back. He took part of the party with one trip, but before he could return for the others, Lorelei and Antimony broke the teleportation stone, forcing the party to teleport to the capital. Again.

  Join us this week to remember what civilization is like!

  <li>This simple sentence summarizes at least fifteen minutes of bickering, last-minute questions, and general confusion.</li>

  <li>One of Jed's warriors, Regnau, revealed her ability to turn into a fearsome dragon. The hobgoblins were greatly displeased, as well as dismembered.</li>

  <li>This unusually high number of survivors did not stem from a newfound sense of benevolence - Amanita came close to making it only one prisoner, but Jed intervened.</li>

  <li>The goblin stole his most prized and easily accessible possession: his bag of ordinary pebbles. Lord Khallus was deeply distraught when he noticed its loss.</li>

  <li>It was already ransacked and emptied - don't get too excited, Pabst.</li>

  <li>He noted that there were more of them than there were of him, and that they had significantly more weapons. The party was somewhat confused by this, since they hadn't even tried to threaten him yet.</li>
