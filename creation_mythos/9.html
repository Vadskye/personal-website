<h2>Killing Everyone and Stealing Stuff Is What We Do Best</h2>
<p>
  Last week, Talia offered the a party a deal. If the party agreed not to tell anyone, and to kill all the witnesses<sup>1</sup>, she would open the portal to a treasure horde that they could ransack. The party would have to share some of the treasure they retrieved, and would also have to make a Shadow Pact -- a magical oath with ambiguously terrible<sup>2</sup> consequences that would force the party to not break their agreement with her. This caused a great deal of discussion and haggling, especially about the identity of this mysterious horde, which Talia refused to elaborate on. The party eventually agreed to make the pact if they could learn about the treasure horde before actually trying to retrieve it.

  Talia led the party to recite the words of the pact, and the magic bound them. She then revealed that the horde belonged to none other than Torvid. This revelation assuaged the party's conscience<sup>3</sup>, and they eagerly set off through the portal.

  On the other side, the party found a large pile of gold, gems, and various glowing items. However, as they set about the horde to gather it up, they alerted the guards. As the party got into position, the door slammed open to reveal two massive trolls in ornately crafted, custom-built full plate. The party briefly attempted to reason with them<sup>4</sup>, but despite their diplomatic efforts, battle was soon joined. The trolls were powerful, with their strength and agility seemingly augmented by their strange armor<sup>5</sup>, but the party managed to defeat them. They then quickly threw everything through the portal and hurried back to Talia. Their mission complete, the party divvied up the spoils, with Antimony performing many rituals to identify the magical properties of various items.

  Show up this week to decide what to do, again!
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The party paid very close attention at this point.</li>

  <li>Not to be confused with "terribly ambiguous", which would be much less dire.</li>

  <li>In the singular sense. Modern gnomish science suggests that whole party's consciences put together add up to about one normal human conscience.</li>

  <li>That's being a bit generous. The party, led by Maxwell and Lord Khallus, tried to claim that they were vault inspectors who worked for Torvid. The trolls actually believed this, but didn't quite go along with the mental leap from that premise to conclude that they should ignore their own orders to kill anyone in the treasure room.</li>

  <li>Though unlike most trolls, these did not visibly regenerate. Inquiring minds may wonder why...</li>
