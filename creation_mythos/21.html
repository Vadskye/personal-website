<h2>Why Did I Plan So Much Combat</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party went through the portal Talia created to reach the mysterious Moravian fortress. Once inside, they found the area creatively redecorated to render teleportation impossible. They also found a group of trolls wearing battle armor, which they dispatched with surprising ease. The ruckus they caused attracted a larger group of Moravian Arkites, including a new type that seemed to teleport all over the battlefield with ease. They joined battle, and found the Arkites more difficult than the trolls. In the middle of the fight, one of the teleporting Arkites grabbed Pabst and channeled a strange magic which caused him to blink out of existence. The fight still rages, but the party is down one member, and their enemies show no signs of letting up...

  Join us this week to save Pabst! Or possibly to be saved by Pabst!
