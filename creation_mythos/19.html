<h2>Despite All Our Rage We Are Still Just A Party In a Cage</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party was taken prisoner<sup>1</sup> by Myaliastaricus, a massive white dragon. In their cage, they found a strangely realistic statue of a dwarf. Reggie recognized it as a petrified creature, and performed a ritual to break the enchantment. When he finished the ritual, the statue transformed into a thoroughly confused and slightly deranged dwarf named Mortin. The party talked with him long enough to ensure that he wouldn't be a threat, but had trouble getting much more information out of him.

  Meanwhile, Myaliastaricus interrogated the party about their purpose in coming the land of the dragons, and seemed to expect that they were there to steal dragon hoards. The party insisted that they were there to help the dragons - and in exchange, the dragons might help the party in return. Myaliastaricus seemed unconvinced that the party could do anything useful to help, but eventually suggested that they go kill Moravian horses guarding a teleportation room under the guise of being reinforcements from Galia to aid the dragons. The party readily agreed, and after being let out of their cage<sup>2</sup>, set off for a teleportation room.

  The party defeated two teleportation rooms full of Moravian horses without much difficulty. Their interrogation of a Moravian Arkite<sup>3</sup> named "One" revealed wildly different information than they had received from the last room - instead of 200 companies with about 20,000 Moravian troops total, he claimed that there were 800 different companies, comprising no less than 300,000 troops. One seemed slightly more intelligent than their previous captives, and they managed to have a short discussion with him. He revealed that he was not able to kill himself, and that he had tried. When asked if he had a weakness, he said "I eat food". However, before the party could get more information out of him, the sigils on One's head began glowing. Shortly afterwards, he attacked the party relentlessly until he was killed. The party found a different Arkite to inform that they were from Galia.

  After clearing out the teleportation rooms, the party returned to their cage and rested for the night. In the morning, they heard approaching footsteps and saw Talia, the Guardian of the Gate, outside their cage.

  <li>More precisely, the party was asked fairly politely if they would walk willingly into a cage, and they agreed.</li>

  <li>They were forced to leave Reggie behind in the cage to keep them from simply teleporting away from the dragon.</li>

  <li>An Arkite is a type of soldier fielded by the Arcanum, one of the five Moravian Orders. Arkites are magically altered with arcane sigils that grant them innate magical power, not unlike a spellwarped. Some of the sigils are devoted to controlling an Arkite's mind, forcing it to obey orders from its Moravian superiors.</li>
