<h2>Finally Leaving Kilvas</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party mucked around in Kilrein for a while. Winston took Lord Khallus and Pabst to see Reletharian, the king of Kilvas, to extoll the virtues of the party<sup>1</sup>. More importantly, Winston also requested a reward from the royal treasury in gratitude for the party's past deeds and to help them in their future endeavors. The fact that the party possessed the Book of Creation proved very helpful in this regard, and Reletharian granted the party a considerable sum. On the way to the royal treasury, Winston also showed the king's chief advisor, Odion, the highly advanced troll armor the party had retrieved from Torvid's forces<sup>2</sup>. This impressed Odion, and provided evidence that the Moravian Empire was secretly backing Torvid.

  The party went shopping in Kilrein with their newfound wealth while Winston handled more politics. When they finished, and when Reggie finished his own preparations, Winston told them that the king was sufficiently convinced to allow the party to use the northern part of Kilvas as a bargaining chip to secure support from Galia and/or the dragons, as necessary. Reggie would help oversee those negotiations as necessary<sup>3</sup>. With that, the party began their journey to Galia.

  Reggie teleported the party to a small city on the northeast side of Galia, where Lord Khallus' father lives. They reunited, and the party convinced the elder Lord Khallus of the importance and truth of their mission<sup>4</sup>. He revealed in return that Galia was also undergoing major turmoil, thanks to agitation from separatist groups protesting the inferior status of non-elves in Galia. A few weeks ago, the separatist movement seized control of the northern territories of Galia, bordering the Spine of the World. At about the same time, a legendary assassin named Nosferatu resurfaced in Kaliatori. In a short time, he killed two members of the Elder Council<sup>5</sup>, the ruling body of Galia. All of this had left Galia fairly uninterested in the seemingly isolated problems that Kilvas faced. However, Lord Khallus offered to accompany the party to Kaliatori, the capital of Galia, to find help for Kilvas.

  <li>This required a number of Bluff checks.</li>

  <li>By some combination of uncommon good sense and sheer luck, the party has managed to avoid breaking their Shadow Pact regarding the origin of this armor. Fortnately, Winston has seemed remarkably incurious about where it came from, after the party assured him that it came from Torvid.</li>

  <li>Reggie actually does have the authority to do this; those with curiosity or local knowledge can readily find that he is the second highest-ranking wizard in the Arcane Brotherhood, the most powerful mage's guild in Kilvas.</li>

  <li>Lord Khallus was especially convinced by the Book of Creation. The revelation that the dwarves were created first was of great interest to him - as well as to the rest of the party, except for Pabst, who knew that all along.</li>

  <li>The Elder Council consists of eleven highly revered elven leaders - one from each of Galia's eleven states. The Council's decrees are obeyed throughout the country, though they only convene as a group to discuss matters of national importance. More minor issues are handled in the Chamber of Elf-Lords. There are 77 elven lords in the Chamber, seven from each state, and they decide matters of ordinary governance by majority vote. Any noble in the country may request an audience in the Chamber, and any lord in the Chamber may request an audience with the Elder Council.</li>

  <li>Not unlike our politics, but more realistic.</li>
