<h2>It Sure Would Be A Shame If We Were Assassinated</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party arrived in Kaliatori, the capital of Galia. The elder Lord Khallus led them through town to find the Chamber of Elf-Lords so they could ask for help against Torvid's army. They found the Chamber, but were stopped by an elven bureaucrat who told them they would have to wait days for an appointment. The party decided they didn't have time to wait, and informed him that they had the Book of Creation. He quickly scuttled off, and returned with a venerable Elf-Lord.
</p>


<p>
  The Elf-Lord introduced himself as Nathaniel. He invited the party to discuss their business with him privately, and they agreed. He told them that they should be more cautious about announcing that they held the Book, for there were many in the city who would pay dearly to have it. He said that he could sponsor them to speak in the Chamber of Elf-Lords more quickly - but they would have to have something to show. They could simply announce that they had the Book of Creation, but that would draw potentially dangerous attention. He advised that they instead look into addressing some of the city's problems - especially the issue of the Separatists, who threatened Galia with civil war. However, the party was much more interested in pursuing Nosferatu, the assassin that had killed two members of the Elder Council. Hearing this, Nathaniel recommended that they seek out Saul, the captain of the guard in Galia.

<p>
  Saul turned out to be a perpetual drunk<sup>1</sup> who inhabited the only ramshackle building the party had seen in the capital. Despite that<sup>2</sup>, he was willing to listen to the party, and was quite supportive of their desire to hunt down Nosferatu. Saul told them that Nosferatu had warned that anyone who tried to discover his identity would become his next target. Between that threat, the significantly enhanced security that now protected the members of the Elder Council, and the weeks that had passed since the previous attacks, the city's efforts to find Nosferatu had largely come to an end. Despite some misgivings, and several threats to throw various members of the party in jail<sup>3</sup>, Saul agreed to help the party find Nosferatu, and told them that he probably had fled to the Undercity<sup>4</sup>.
</p>


<p>
  Armed with this knowledge, the party - led by Lord Khallus<sup>5</sup> - came up with a plan. They put up wanted posters around the city, near sewer grates that led to the Undercity, advertising their interests in Nosferatu and an address for an inn where they would be staying that night. The party woke up the next morning to find that they had not been assassinated - but that Saul requested their presence as soon as possible.
</p>


<p>
  When the party went to find Saul, he told them that Nathaniel had been attacked in the night by Nosferatu. Saul had saved his life<sup>6</sup>, but Nathaniel was still badly wounded. The party quickly went to see Nathaniel, and told him that they had a new plan: they would disguise one of their party members as Nathaniel, and when the assassin came back to finish the job, they would ambush the assassin together and defeat him. Impressed by their bravery, Nathaniel allowed Lorelei to assume his appearance. Together, the party returned to Nathaniel's house and set up their ambush.

  Join us this week to find out what happens when you try to ambush a legendary assassin!
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Probably. Experienced eyes noticed that he seemed suspiciously coordinated and alert for someone as drunk as he appeared to be.</li>

  <li>Or more likely, because of that - all things considered, it helped him fit in with the party.</li>

  <li>Encouraged by other members of the party, naturally.</li>

  <li>The Undercity is a vast underground network of tunnels and ruins that lies beneath Kaliatori - remnants of the city that existed before Kaliatori became what it is today. It can be accessed through the sewer system, though few know exactly how.</li>

  <li>At this point, you should consider feeling a sense of impending doom.</li>

  <li>Technically, Nathaniel actually did die, but Saul chased away the assassin before he could bind Nathaniel's soul. As a result, Nathaniel was resurrected without too much fuss.</li>
