<h2>Into the Hall of the Mountain Cannon</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party defeated the rest of the Arkites that had attacked them. One managed to escape, but they captured and interrogated three others. The prisoners revealed the purpose of the hidden fortress: the Leviathan Cannon, a massive machine designed to fire on Kaliatori, the capital of Galia, hundreds of miles away<sup>1</sup>. It would fire as soon as the storm abated. The prisoners were then summarily executed by Lord Khallus<sup>2</sup>.

<p>
  The party resolved to stop the cannon, though they were unsure whether to strike the cannon directly or save Pabst. They decided to split the difference by resting while Reggie scryed on Pabst. He determined that Pabst was located in a jail cell in an unknown location, so the party resolved to ignore his plight and strike directly at the cannon.
</p>


<p>
  Before they finished resting, Pabst ran up and quickly explained that he had escaped from a jail cell, and was currently being pursued by about a dozen Arkites. Their rest interrupted, the party decided to avoid a head-on fight that would take more time. Instead, they set up a quick defensive barrier<sup>3</sup> and ran for the stairs that would take them to the Leviathan Cannon.

<p>
  Show up this week to try to save Kaliatori!

  <li>The gross physical implausibility of such a device apparently did not stop the Moravians from building it anyway.</li>

  <li>In his defense, they were starting to flare their head sigils, and were probably going to attack. On the other hand, he would have killed them anyway.</li>

  <li>And an explosive undead mecha troll.</li>
