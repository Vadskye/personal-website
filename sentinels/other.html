These decks don't fit neatly into any of the other collections.

<h2>Vine</h2>
<p>
This is a meme deck based on the ancient and tragically deceased social video platform, Vine. It is not part of a collection, may or may not be any good, and really just exists so that you can say "heh I remember that video, it was funny" when you play it. Trying to come up with Sentinels-style mechanics to try to awkwardly capture the essence of six second funny videos was a fun challenge.
