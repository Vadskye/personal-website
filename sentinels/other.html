<h2>Karn</h2>
<p>
Karn is a hero deck that represents an ancient time-travelling silver golem from Magic: the Gathering.
He dates back to the early days of the Magic storyline, and has had many adventures over the decades.

Mechanically, Karn's unique niche comes from his ability to turn equipment cards into targets that can then punch things. He primarily operates as a mixed support/damage hero by playing a lot of equipment with supporting effects and animating them into targets that can punch things on their own. He barely deals any damage himself, but if his animated equipments stay in play long enough, they can end up dealing quite a bit of damage thanks to March of the Machines. He breaks a core Sentinels rule by having five copies of his core card that animates equipment, but I think it makes sense for his deck - I want to keep his maximum target count limited, but the ratio felt better at five than four.

<h2>Vine</h2>
<p>
This is a meme deck based on the ancient and tragically deceased social video platform, Vine. It is not part of a collection, may or may not be any good, and really just exists so that you can say "heh I remember that video, it was funny" when you play it. Trying to come up with Sentinels-style mechanics to try to awkwardly capture the essence of six second funny videos was a fun challenge.
