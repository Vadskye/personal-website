<h1>Ravnica</h1>
This collection of decks is based on <a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Ravnica">Ravnica</a>, which a plane of existence in <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/">Magic: the Gathering</a>, by Wizards of the Coast.

Ravnica is a vast city ruled by ten guilds, each of which represents a particular combination of two of the five colors in Magic. The personality of each guild is designed to reflect the combination of the philosophies of those two colors. In Sentinels-land, I've translated that into one environment deck for each guild.
