<h2>Heroes</h2>

<h3>Bruno</h3>
<p><i>His lavish beard and pink tights strike fear into the hearts of his foes.</i></p>
<p>
Bruno's playstyle is simple: equip armor and weapons, and smash your foes with them. Like all Krumit's Tale decks, his equipment has a durability mechanic: use it too much, and it self-destructs. This makes them play a little more like slow-release one-shots than traditional Sentinels ongoing/equipment cards, and helps prevent stagnation from having all of your buildup cards in play already (hi, Wraith).
</p>
<p>
Bruno leans more heavily into the equipment theme that than the other decks. Most of his cards are equipment, and he has cards to manipulate the durability of his equipment so he can keep using them longer. He also has a 4x ongoing that rewards him for perfectly blocking damage, allowing him to contribute damage and make sure the game ends within a reasonable time frame even while he's purely tanking. Overall, Bruno tends to play like a tank that requires active decision-making to optimally block and parry damage.

<h3>Greybeard</h3>
<p><i>A powerful wizard and resident old guy at Meteorfall Tavern.</i></p>
<p>
Greybeard is a blaster caster. He has three different types of spells: cold, fire, and lightning. Cold spells deal small amounts of damage, but can freeze foes to prevent them from dealing damage. Fire spells are best for single-target damage, and have some internal combos to yield large DPS bursts if you spend several turns focusing on a single target. Lightning spells do burst AOE damage, but require a discard cost to compensate for their immediate power. He also has a small selection of equipment that gives him alternate power options to round out his kit.

<h3>Mischief</h3>
<p><i>Her face is often found on "Wanted" posters, as her name suggests.</i></p>
<p>
Mischief is a rogueish stabby sort. In the game, she's strongest against "solitary" enemies that aren't near other foes, and it's not too hard to manipulate the board state to chain enemies through a solitary state. In Sentinels, this is represented by making her strongest against the lowest HP target in a given play area, allowing you to continue a similar chain by killing each enemy in order. Her deck has a "Stab" theme, where she can play self-cycling stab cards that do chip damage. This allows her to more easily manipulate which target is considered the lowest HP before she uses her cards and powers that affect the target with the lowest HP. Overall, she tends to play like a DPS.

<h3>Muldorf</h3>
<p><i>Once known as The Great Muldorf, this gin drinking hero accidentally consumed the spirit of an evil genie. He now walks the earth as Muldorf: Necrodude!</i></p>
<p>
Muldorf is a necromantic who summons skeletons to fight for him. His skeletons can protect him from damage, and as the game goes on he can augment them with infernal magicks to make them damage-dealers in their own right. He also has cards to drain the life from his enemies which help him recover from some self-damage cards. Overall, he is a durable tank that is strongest in target-heavy games but can function alone.

<h3>Rose</h3>
<p><i>Pure on the outside, but a hint of darkness within.</i></p>
<p>
Rose is a priest who wields a mixture of holy magic and curses to smite her foes. Like Skyscraper, she has two forms that she can switch between frequently during the game: "Chosen" form, which uses radiant magic to banish curses, and "Queen of Shadows" form, which curses herself and others to gain more powerful effects. She is strategically complex, and properly managing your curse effects and self-damage is critical.

<h3>Varfa and Orhu</h3>
<p><i>
When Varfa came across Orhu abandoned in the jungle one day, she remarked how cute he looked. It wasn't until his first tantrum that she knew better.
</i></p>
<p>
Varfa is a ranger, and Orhu is her trained companion. Together, they hunt their foes with a tag-team takedown! They both start the game in play, and some cards cause Varfa to deal damage while others cause Orhu to deal damage. Varfa has traps, arrows, and technology, while Orhu has more personal buildup effects and can deal more damage once fully trained.
