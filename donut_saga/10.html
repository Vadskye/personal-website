<h2>Barriers & Bears</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party set about trying to enter the Sekerren Ruins.Their progress was blocked by a large cold iron door left by the Nullwardens. Although it was not magically warded, it was both intricately crafted and resilient to magic, forcing the party to get creative. They decided to dig around the outside of the door to access the tunnel behind it by going through the packed dirt and eventually solid rock. This was challenging, but not as impossible as going directly through the door. Wei crafted some sturdy shovels, and the party set to work digging, with Bench and Gregory taking the lead. Only Din Morat was able to dig stealthily, perhaps due to the intrinsic difficulty in describing what exactly "digging stealthily" even means, and the party quickly attracted attention from nearby mutated wildlife.

  This time, the elemental animal that angrily assaulted everyone appeared as an electrically enhanced bear. The bear was the size of a small house, and in no mood to be dissauded from is murderous rage. Briar set up a layer of barrier walls with a little embrasure to allow the less direct members of the party to easily attack the bear while the front line warriors engaged it. Wei angered the bear with her stuffed animal attack, and it tried to rush around the barrier to maul her. However, Gregory and Bench - and once, just Bench alone - resisted the bear's overrun attempts with their mighty fortitude, forcing it to stay directly engaged with them. With the bear unable to reach the anyone more vulnerable to its rending claws or constant waves of electricity, the party managed to defeat it with minimal risk. After the fight, the party rested again and resumed their digging regime.
