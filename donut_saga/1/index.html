<h2>Greetings & Golems</h2>

<p>
  A ragtag group of adventurers named Briar, McSmashy, Anwen Jord, Din Morat, and Wei woke up. They found themselves bereft of their belongings and locked in an underground cell with no memory of how they got there. They took this in stride, introduced themselves, and immediately set about trying to escape the cell. A quick knock at the door caused an unknown voice to tell them "Hey! Stop That! Go Back To Your Cell!" in an oddly gloopy and not entirely human voice. Since they were already in the cell, they decided not to pay the voice much heed, so McSmashy set about trying to take the solitary bench off of the wall so she could use it to bash the door down. While she was working on that, Din Morat surreptitiously took out some hidden lockpicks and unlocked the door. The newly formed party almost contemplated carefully what their plan was before McSmashy smashed the door open and barged out into the unknown world beyond.

  The area outside of their cell turned out to contain an inviting ladder, a couple of doors, and a pair of fungus golems that repeatedly yelled at them to Stop That and Go Back to Your Cell, but the party paid them no heed. Instead, they tried to simultaneously pursue an eclectic mix of strategies, including but not limited to: smashing the golems to tiny pieces, climbing up the ladder to try to escape, throwing torches at the golems to burn them up, stealthily avoiding the golems, and bravely trying to rescue endangered members of the party who were caught by golems. Eventually, they determined that the trapdoor at the top of the ladder was unwilling to allow them passage, and they all worked together to successfully convert the golems to went-lems.

  In the aftermath of the carnage, Din Morat stealthily crept into one of the nearby rooms after carefully scoping it out through the keyhole, trying to make sure that there were no enemies to threaten the party. After a short delay, Anwen Jord burst boldly into the same room and completely interrupted that plan. Fortunately, the room was a kitchen, so the caution was unnecessary - this time. The kitchen was both empty of enemies and full of common kitchen items such as a nice kitchen knife, a well made stew pot, and chest containing all of the party's stolen items. The chest also contained some extra items, and a note indicating that the items belonged to another group of unfortunate souls. The party reconvened, observed through a keyhole that the other door led to a room with more ominously putrescent fungus golems, and began plotting their next move.
