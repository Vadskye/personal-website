<h2>Voyages & Varmints</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party decided that the time had come to leave the big city. It was too big, too complicated, and too full of quests. Better to go out into the wilderness and hope that everything worked itself out when they got back. They left Melvin in the hands of the Nullwardens via Gregory and set off to explore the Sekerren Ruins.
</p>

<p>
  The journey was mostly uneventful until they approached the Bramblepatch thanks to the party's greater experience in the wilderness. In the deep forest beyond the roads, however, even their superior navigation abilities were insufficient to avoid a fight with a pair of mutated flaming boars wandering the woods. The boars were surronded with a dangerous flaming aura that seared anyone nearby, and the party had to tactically avoid overlapping the auras unnecessarily to take the boars down. Briar displayed some surprising skill with knife throwing, which helped against the boars which were more resistant to vitality-affecting attacks.
</p>

<p>
  After defeating the boars, the party circled around the Bramblepatch and followed the same dry stream bed that they originally used to each the center, which was still the easiest access to the center. Along the way, they were attacked by a pair of flaming orangutans that seemed stronger and more accustomed to their bodies than the one the party had fought before.
</p>

<p>
  Bench and Gregory charged forward to meet the orangutans while the rest of the party stayed back and supported them from the sidelines. They split up to fight each orangutan individually to avoid being hit by the orangutans' dangerous windmill tornado slam. Gregory carefully and consistently whittled his down while minimizing damage, and Bench's more aggressive fighting style - combined with the rest of the party's focus - killed both their orangutan and themselves significantly faster. Bench was forced to retreat before the end of the fight to avoid dying, which was a first, but the party did manage to finish off both orangutans after suffering multiple vital wounds.
</p>

<p>
  Battered but undeterred, the party pressed forward and reached the clearing at the center of the Bramblepatch that housed the Sekerren Ruins. They took a long rest to recover their strength, and prepared to face their next challenges with a higher level of energy.
