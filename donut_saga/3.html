<h2>Sneks & Snips</h2>

<p>
  The party struck out into the woods for a while during the dark of night, trying to cover their tracks as best they could. The dark of the night pressed in on them ominously, and the unknown woods could hold any manner of strange creature, so the party found an inviting-looking tree and settled in to sleep the rest of the night away. Some hours later, in the dark of night, Briar noticed a strange slithering sound approaching. She quickly woke everyone up so they would be prepared for the group of magically modified cold-infused snakes that were aggressively approaching the camp. The party, as usual, was undecided on what to do. They immediately and simultaneously tried to calm the snakes, blast them with magic, and flee from the camp. When all three strategies proved ineffective on their own, they decided to work together to defeat the snakes. After a difficut battle full of smashing and blasting and really excessive amounts of poison, they succeeded, and went elsewhere in the woods to find a safer place to sleep.

  The next morning, the party began marching through the woods to find Praxis. Along the way, they found a pleasant-looking clearing that was warm and inviting, which they desperately avoided at all costs. Afterwards, they found a massive area of forest that was filled with strangely twisted and ominously overgrown trees. An angry ooking echoed in the distance. They very nearly ventured into the deep woods to see what it was like, though they eventually made the agonizing decision to avoid the dark cluster of brambles for the time being.

  After avoiding several opportunities for adventure, the party was starting to wonder what their objective actually was, and decided to focus on reaching the closer town of Verda before going all the way to Praxis, which may or may not be dangerous for some members of the group. Along the way, the party found a strange stream that seemed to be flowing uphill. They decided to investigate the source of the magic that was pushing the water back up the stream, so they ventured upstream, downhill, and in the general direction of the Expanse. At the end of the water, the party saw a massive wolf with a sigil of the moon in its fur...

  Join us this week to make friends with and/or murder the strange wolf and hopefully find your way back to some semblance of civilization!
