<h2>Ditches & Demons</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party investigated the meeting location where Lilian Smith, the current mayor, would meet with Mammon's agent on the far outskirts of Praxis that night. Thanks to Mikolash and Millie's magical senses, they found no less than three demon calling rituals hidden in the ground around the meeting site. Diplo destroyed them all with his remarkable ability to smash through virtually anything, then he and Ayala covered the signs of their tampering with plants and pleasant water pools. After destroying the magic circles, the party decided that they were ready, so they hid Ayala deep in one of the pools while the rest of the party clustered around Gregory in the air, using his aura to mask their glowing Mystic Auras.

  That night, as the time of the meeting approached, the party saw the mayor approaching the meeting site from the main city. Before she arrived, Ayala and Chort noticed an invisible figure sneaking up to the meeting site. They watched it skulk around for a bit, but before it could do anything too nefarious Ayala bubbled it and the fight began.

  Most of the party rode Ayala's summoned air elementals down to get closer to ground level, but Diplo launched himself as a meteor of smashy death at the figure. His leafy mystic aura revealed the agent's apparent shape as a fairly generic-looking woman. She noticed Ayala in the water, but instead of attacking, she ran to two of the demon calling circles that the party had destroyed and futilely tried to activate them. At the second circle, she realized that no aid was coming. She did her best to fight the party alone, but she was wildly outnumbered and surrendered after she became bloodied without inflicting significant damage on the party.

  After the fight, the party interrogated the mysterious interloper. She introduced herself as Andreth Misrael, and confirmed that she was an agent of Mammon in the city. She was a demon - one of many called to this plane by the fifth ritual site hidden deep in the Storm Peaks. Some demon lords had apparently been willing to help Mammon under the premise that, if she succeeded in wiping out magic, Praxis would become easy pickings for demonic manipulation and/or invasion. However, now that the rituals were being destroyed and Mammon was in hiding, the demons were unwilling to extend additional aid. On a personal level, Andreth said that she just wanted to leave this miserable and chilly plane. She agreed to help the party by navigating them through Prax's Labyrinth, but warned them that Mammon herself was far beyond the power they displayed in their fight against her. The party decided to trust her enough to let her guide them, but not so much that they wouldn't bind her and keep a very close eye on her before entering the Labyrinth.
