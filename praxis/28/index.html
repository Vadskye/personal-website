<h2>Angels & Arenas</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the Cultists of The Aboleth<sup>1</sup> told the party that a powerful emissary of Mammon was flying at great speed towards the ritual site. It would still take about twelve hours to arrive, so the party decided to stay put and finish Mikolash's work to disable the ritual. After another grueling eight hours, Mikolash and the cultists finished their ritual, and with a distant chorus of pops the legion of dragons disappeared from existence and the faint shimmering in the air faded away. Having been awake for over 30 hours, Mikolash immediately fell asleep<sup>2</sup>, and the cultists tried to get some rest as well. Nyjel asked the party if The Aboleth had any more demands for them. The party decided that the cultists would be helpful for disabling the ritual site in Praxis, so they decided that they would all head back to Praxis together after dealing with the emissary of Mammon. The cultists also shared the ancient dragon hoard they had found in the hidden ritual dungeon with the party, which was nice.

<p>
  Four hours later, a mighty and imposing angel arrived outside the ritual site. It bellowed at the cultists through the closed door into the main complex in an awe-inspiring voice that would have compelled lesser mortals to flee in fear, then smashed through the door with a single blow. It was immediately taken aback by a flood of about 150,000 gallons that Ayala had conjured to create a battle arena - just in case it was necessary. Momentarily nonplussed, the angel addressed the party directly, saying its name was Azyrius, and demanded to know by what right they had subverted Mammon's cultists and destroyed the sacred ritual. Ayala and Chort both had incredible sensory abilities, and realized that the "angel" actually wore an illusion. Its true form had a bat-like wings and a number of horns, and more closely resembled a demon than an angel.

<p>
  The party as a whole was unimpressed with Azyrius's bluster, and flatly responded that they had destroyed the ritual as they had destroyed others, and would be coming for Praxis's ritual soon. Azyrius responded angrily, and in the course of the conversation the party learned that Mammon had four territories governed by rituals: the forests, the desert, the mountain, and the city. Azyrius refused to indicate the exact number of ritual sites, but when it tried to lie that there were hundreds of ritual sites, the party became convinced that there were a very small number of ritual sites overall. In the end, the party let Azyrius leave in a huff to report back to Mammon about the party's actions.

<p>
  After the conversation, the party decided that it finally time to return to Praxis. They gathered up the Cultists of the Aboleth, summoned mighty steeds, and set forth. During the multi-day journey, Millie finally recovered from her many wounds. She also received a strange message from her family which she shared with the party: "Dearest Sable daughter: We deeply appreciate your recent efforts. Please return to us at your earliest convenience. You have earned your place.". The party was unsure how to take that message, and Millie was outraged that they didn't even seem to remember her name. The party also received a short message via animal companion from Ellenforma: "I met a nice young druid lad and together we shut down the ritual! Thanks for the help :) Hope you're doing well! Come visit sometime." As they approached Praxis, the edges of Mammon's plan seemed to be crumbling - but who knows what they would find there?

  Join us this week to find out what's been happening in Praxis!

  <li>There was some confusion about the aboleth's name. In fact, the aboleth never told the party its name. Since the aboleth is almost certainly the only aboleth on this plane thanks to the whole magical apocalypse thing, The Aboleth is a perfectly reasonable way to refer to it.</li>
  <li>As did Mikolash's player.</li>
