<h2>Grains & Golems</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party decided to release the kidnappers hired by the Sables - after liberating them of anything valuable, of course - and continue into the Expanse. The shifting sand was difficult to walk on, so the party decided to travel in slightly more comfort than simply trudging through the sand. Ayala used the new ritual that Mikolash taught her to summon a horse for everyone. Since Charlie and Mikolash weren't confident in their riding ability, Charlie constructed a carriage so that they could ride in comfort.

<p>
  While the party rode majestically through the desert and temperature steadily increased, they heard a strange shifting in the sand coming from in front of them. They prepared for combat, and were greeted by a pair of massive sand golems that burrowed through the sand to smash the party with massive slam attacks while buried. Diplo tried to dissuade his golemish brethren from attacking, but tragically his words were unable to put a stop to the violence. Ayala used her rushing water attack to smash the sand out of the way so the party could see the golems more easily, and the melee folks rode their horses into melee. The golems' unusual composition allowed them to easily grab and consume the party, both with their massive slam attacks and simply by rushing through the party's ranks, and they were able to grind the things they had consumed into dust.

  The golems quickly dispatched most of the party's horses and swept through the group, disrupting the battle lines and shuffling everyone chaotically around the battlefield. Chort struggled to make his way through the desert sand, especially since he has a tendency to fall over in combat even on steady ground. However, his flaming sword was the perfect weapon for attacking the sand golems, and both he and Simon inflicted serious damage in the fight. Mikolash managed to temporarily disable one of the golems by attacking its magical construction, which attracted their attention. He escaped on the carriage for a while, but one of them managed to outrun him and cover him in dirty sand that was course and irritating and got everywhere. The party killed the golems and rescued him before long, but it was very scary.

  Join us this week to continue into the Expanse and try to find the source of potentially dangerous magic!
