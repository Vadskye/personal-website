<h2>Golems & Guile</h2>

<p>
  The party continued deeper into the Sekerren Ruins past the remains of the fungus, leaving Diplo behind due to its toxic coating. Charlie decided to stay behind to keep Diplo company. Before the party got far, they were stopped by a strange fungus golem that spoke with them (with a ~12 second delay). It apparently bore the voice of Ellenforma, a witch who took over this area about six months ago to tap into its ambient magical power. This was surprising to Gregory, since according to his information, the ruins had been sealed for years. Ellenforma said that she was responsible for both creating the fungus golem and magically mutating the apes in the forest. Through the course of the conversation, the party became convinced that Ellenforma wanted to experiment on them and magically mutate them as well. They considered simply leaving, but Ellenforma threatened to keep them there by force and mentioned that there was a dragon hoard deeper in the tunnels. She offered to have the golem lead them safely to her lair, but cautioned them to follow the golem to the left at an upcoming fork to ensure that they made it to her safely. If they took the fork on the right, they might accidentally find the dragon hoard, which would make her mad. After some brief discussion, the party decided that they would absolutely follow the golem to the left and that they would not even consider taking the path to the dragon hoard, so the golem started leading them deeper into the ruins.

  When the party came to the fork, they immediately booked it to the right, leaving the slow golem in the dust. Their path began slanting downward more steeply, and in their haste to escape the golem, they overlooked a pressure plate in the ground. The pressure plate unleashed an immense flood of sickening water behind them that swept them down the tunnel deeper into the unknown depths. After a short journey, the party ended up in a cylindrical pit flooded with water along with a fungus golem that was swept up along the way. The party awkwardly fought the golem while treading water, with Ayala, Chort, and Gregory hoisting the less skilled swimmer on their shoulders during the fight. During the fight, Ellenforma threatened the party and laughed at them for falling into her devious trap. When the golem was defeated, it exploded, but the party managed to avoid serious injury.

  Ayala took the lead in exploring the depths of the pool with her swimming ability. She found two locked portals with no signs of an opening device on the side the party was on. Although the party couldn't pick the lock or bash the door open underwater, Ayala's water magic worked fine, and she was able to break the door down. The party rushed through the door together and found a small break room with a number of fungus golems standing around awkwardly staring at tables that held old, uneaten food and dusty decks of cards. The golems lurched into motion and attacked the party, but they worked together to defeat the golems while minimizing the danger from the exploding golems.
