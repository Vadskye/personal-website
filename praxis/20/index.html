<h2>Turtles & Tales</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party spent some time figuring out how to share their magical buffs between each other, which was very exciting for them and made Gregory twitchy. Once they got that sorted out, they sent Ayala down the next layer of stairs to explore again. She found a fairly large room with a massive stone turtle blocking a door. There was also a humanoid golem made of wood. She sealed the wood golem in a water bubble, and the wood golem responded by trying to talk to her. It demanded to know why the party had intruded on its master's work. The rest of the party joined Ayala and they talked with the golem for a while.

  The wood golem tried to convince the party to leave, or to be helpful to its master, but the conversation wasn't really going anywhere until Diplo explained that he was actually a servant of the master who was simply returning for further instructions. Since Diplo does look like a wood golem, and is extremely good at lying, the wood golem was willing to let Diplo pass. It instructed the massive stone turtle to move aside and allow Diplo to pass through. Diplo was about to make it through the door and see what was on the other side when Mikolash decided to create a wall that would prevent the turtle from returning to its position to block the door, allowing the whole party to rush through and enter the next room. However, the rest of the party had not been consulted on this plan and didn't think it was a good idea to rush through and leave two possible threats behind, so the only thing the barrier accomplished was making the stone turtle angry. It started attacking the barrier, which failed because the barrier was too strong, so it moved on to attacking the party.

  Diplo tried to convince the stone turtle that the wood golem was the real traitor, which was far more effective than it should have been. That helped buy time for the rest of the party to focus their attacks on the stone turtle. It was extraordinarily resilient, and had the ability to smash its body into the ground to create a devastating shockwave against everyone nearby, so it was a long and difficult fight. The wood golem was destroyed by the stone turtle, but before it died it called for aid, and a squad of sheep-shaped sand golems answered its call from the next room. The golambs rammed into the party, sending out puffs of sand whenever they hit, but Ayala and Millie were able to destroy them en masse with their spells - aided by the stone turtle, whose earthquakes hurt itself and the golambs as much as the party. Diplo and Chort fought on the front lines, wounding the stone turtle every round, until Diplo and Charlie were bloodied by a particularly devastating earthquake, causing them to retreat. Chort bravely stayed in the fight even after he was bloodied until he was finally knocked unconscious by a serious injury. Gregory rushed Chort upstairs to keep him safe while the rest of the party tried to hold the turtle at bay, with Gregory returning as soon as he could to hold the front lines with only Simon and Treecka for company. The stone turtle was finally destroyed by a devastating combination of fire and water magic from Millie and Ayala that broke it apart at the seams.
