<h2>Sandstorms & Shrines</h2>


<p>
  Last week, the party repaired their carriage and themselves from the damage they took during the fight and continued deeper into the desert. As they approached the mysterious source of magic, they found a suspicious stationary sandstorm that shielded their destination from access. Ayala tried to investigate the sandstorm magically, but the tearing winds destroyed the scrying sensor immediately. She talked with the air of the storm to learn more about its nature, and it confirmed that it was being magically controlled, but had little useful information to offer. Charlie and Chort reinforced and enlarged the carriage further so it could keep the party safe through the sandstorm, but it proved not to be necessary when Mikolash dispelled the magic of the sandstorm entirely.

  With the sandstorm gone, the party saw a massive stepped pyramid with a pair of massive and definitely not alive statues guarding the stairs to the top. Mikolash recognized the pyramid from his studies as being originally a temple dedicated to an ancient dragon god. It had originally been the home of a dragon, but the dragon was killed hundreds of years ago by the Nullwardens in their periodic purges of potential dangers to Praxis. He came to the conclusion that the source of magic in this area might be related to the corpse of that dragon, just like the source of magic in the Sekerren Ruins. Ayala scouted the top of the pyramid with her arcane eye and found a hidden door at the top which would presumably allow entrance into the main body of the pyramid.

  The party approached the pyramid and was entirely unsurprised when the statues came to life and began attacking them. It was a challenging fight, primarily due to the sandy terrain that made it hard for people to keep their feet. Gregory was forced to resort to dwarf-tossing to get Chort in the fight, and to keep him there when the clay golems kept punting him back into the desert. The clay golems had a natural regeneration ability, but it was weakened by the removal of the sandstorm and fully removed by Chort and Camilla's endless barrage of fire damage, so they were destroyed without causing any serious injuries to the party.

  Join us this week to finally leave the shifting sands of the desert behind and enter the ancient pyramid!
