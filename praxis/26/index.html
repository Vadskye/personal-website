<h2>Winds & Wounds</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party charged into battle against a colossal white dragon and four large black dragons. The party was prepared for the dragons' massive breath weapons and high-flying tactics, having learned from their previous dragon-related experience. They spread out to avoid being easy breath weapon targets and relied on their collection of gigantic summons to attract the brunt of the dragons' attention. The party also enthusiastically tapped into the enhanced magic of the area. Ayala summoned a house-sided water bubble to trap the house-sided white dragon, and rushed back and forth across the battlefield inside suddenly appearing two hundred foot long rivers. Millie's fireballs were also house-sized, which nearly burned the party the first time she used them. Chort took advantage of his magically spring-enhanced armor to bounce majestically across the battlefield and to spring-launch Simon back away from the fight when he was in danger. Mikolash set about systematically disassembling each dragon's magical auras, removing the white dragon's protections and winter aura and the black dragons' acidic blood. Diplo managed to climb onto the white dragon without it noticing in the chaos of the fight, allowing him to smash it with extreme force. Gregory rode into battle on one of Ayala's summons and entered the middle of the fight to draw as much attention as he could. Meanwhile, the rangers and druids tried their best, and they actually succeeded with an Earthbind once or twice.

  The dragons wreaked havoc on the forest with terrifying force, but the party's experienced use of the magical energy of the area and tactical coordination proved superior to the dragons' raw power, and they managed to bring down the colossal white dragon while only suffering the loss of half a dozen rangers and druids and a few of the summons. This was significantly accelerated by Diplo's incredible mage-slaying power, which allowed him to inflict two vital wounds on the white dragon in a single blow. With the white dragon gone, Millie experimented with her magic and discovered that she could completely destroy one of the black dragons with a single spell by severing the summoning magic that created them. Unfortunately, this immediately enraged the remaining three black dragons, and they all converged on her in a frenzy to stop her from picking them off one by one. Millie bravely continued focusing on her dismissal magic, and the party swarmed around their frenzy, so in a single brutal round two more black dragons were destroyed - but Millie was virtually unprotected, and took an absurd eight vital wounds in exchange. The party fully expected her to be dead, but when the acidic smoke cleared, she still stood, undaunted by the pain. The single black dragon recognized that its power had been wildly surpassed, and desperately fled the battle. The party rushed to tend to Millie's wounds, which were severe despite her bravado.
