<h2>Labyrinths & Lovers</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party rested overnight with their new friend/captive, Andreth Misrael, while Gregory went to the Nullwardens to prepare his strike team. Andreth tried to convince Millie of the virtues of going to Hell, and Millie was surprisingly receptive to the idea. The next morning, when the party went around town grabbing all of their allies to finally enter the Labyrinth, they found that the Nullwardens had been attacked in the night by a group of demons. As far as the Nullwardens could tell, the demons were specifically targeting Gregory, but they failed to cause him more than a small new scar on his arm. To Ayala, this was a terrible affront, and after she admonished him for both getting hurt and scaring her, she kissed him on the cheek. This was about the second or third time that this had happened, and Gregory was starting to get used to that idea, so he actually kissed her back on the cheek afterwards. The Nullwardens around the party were extremely unimpressed with this whole nonsense.

  After gathering Gregory's strike team of fourteen Nullwardens, the eight Cultists of the Aboleth, and eight mercenaries from the Sables trained in tunnel fighting, the party delved into Prax's Labyrinth itself. The Nullwardens shielded the group from both the labyrinth's twisting passages and the backlash from the ritual itself as they marched towards its core. Andreth guided the party through the Labyrinth as she promised. While the party was making their way through the tunnels, they were attacked by a horde of augmented humans with strange spikes, claws, and ghost-like teleportation abilities. For some reason, they didn't surrender when Ayala suggested it. The party's vast army was able to easily wipe out the horde of enemies with only one casualty from one of the Sable mercenaries. Mikolash was able to use his medical abilities to revive the injured mercenary, and the army continued into the tunnels without any losses. Later, they fought another army with the same result.

  As the party approached the heart of the ritual, they were met in their path by a white-haired human-looking woman. She introduced herself as the famous Mammon, and warned the party in dire terms about the danger of magic. The party had heard this speech several times before, so they were unimpressed. Mammon said that she had been alive since at least the time of the apocalypse, and that she had been created by Prax with an explicit mission to preserve civilization and prevent it from taking the same destructive path as it had before. According to her, the apocalypse a thousand years ago was only the latest in a series of destructive cataclysms that threatened the future of life in the world, each worse than the last. The party thought that, whether or not that's true, they could avert that eventuality without sacrificing all magic. When it became clear that conflict was inevitable, Mammon summoned a horde of her ghost minions, and the battle began.

  Join us next session to try to put an end to the terror that Mammon inflicted on Praxis and the world!
