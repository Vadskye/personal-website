<h2>Spreadsheets & Sorcery</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party spent quite a long time in a delusional haze talking about "levels" and "feats". It's possible that the magic of the dragon bones was affecting them. Eventually they emerged from their haze and found a secret journal in Alistair's room listing twenty-one other golems he had used to infiltrate other groups in society and adventuring parties, including both the Sables and the Macayhils. They contemplated the implications of the list while they held an impromptu funeral for Charlie. Camilla did the honors of burning his body alive. After the funeral, Chort used his gift from Whitefall to ask her if she had any advice for how to deal with the golems and/or dragon bones. Among other, less relevant contributions, Whitefall offered some advice about how to identify golems, and confirmed that she was able to sense golems and was confident that there were no golems in or around the town of Whitefall.

  With Whitefall's somewhat useful advice in hand, the party turned their attention to the dragon bones, and decided to try to destroy them. Based on suspicions about the potential danger and difficulty involved in destroying the bones, they decided to bring the bones outside to destroy them. When they left the pyramid, they saw a swarm of otyugholems trying to enter the pyramid.

  Join us this week to fight your way out of the pyramid and try to destroy the dragon bones!
