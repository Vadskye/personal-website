<h2>Hoards & Hardcovers</h2>

<p>
  The party rested after their fight against the golems and began exploring their damp surroundings. To the north, they found a pleasant little research library primarily devoted to transformative magic like Polymorph. Naturally, Mikolash was very excited, and he started diving through the writing - especially a cryptic handwritten log on the desk describing the results of practical experimentation with transformative magic. The rest of the party quickly exhausted the entertainment value of the library and continued off to the east, where they found a large door at the end of a tunnel. The door contained a handwritten message in Common apparently written by Ellenforma that warned of great danger in the room beyond, and that the door should under no circumstances be opened. The party naturally opened it.

  When the party opened the door, they found their curiosity rewarded by a dragon hoard - and a dragon! Or at least a strange fungus-infected animated corpse of a dragon. They quickly tried to retreat, but the dragon noticed them and smashed through the door in pursuit. The party was nearly overwhelmed in the tunnel, but Gregory's defensive prowess combined with Mikolash's barriers (once he finally looked up from his research) allowed the party to stabilize and set up a defensive position in the room where they fought the golems. The battle  in the room got off to a good start with a devastating critical from Diplo that took out one of its eyes, but the dragon was too durable to fall quickly. Gregory focused on drawing the dragon's attention and trying desperately to avoid being eaten while the rest of the party peppered it with ranged attacks. As Gregory became increasingly wounded, Camilla bravely stepped in to try to use her fire more effectively up close, and was quickly swallowed by the dragon and neary devoured before Gregory yanked her safely back out. Eventually, the party's remarkable and increasingly necessary teamwork allowed them to put the corpse to rest, though their resources were nearly exhausted. In the aftermath of the battle, the party went back to the hoard and found a well deserved reward in the form of piles of money, a variety of small magic items, a new feat, and a level up.
