<h2>Warnings & Worms</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party killed time while they waited for Ayala to return from the lake. Mikolash learned a number of rituals with the help of the druids, while Chort and Camilla improved their ability to cook with non-civilized ingredients. A few hours before Ayala was due to emerge, Gregory received a messenger hawk from the Nullwardens. The note said that the Nullwardens were bringing a significant force into the mountains to destroy the Circle of the Black Sun, and asked Gregory if he had found them in the mountains. The party was generally on board with giving the Nullwardens the location of the druids, but decided to wait for Ayala to emerge before sending the hawk back. When Ayala emerged from the water, Camilla chewed her out for leaving so suddenly and Gregory seemed relieved that she had escaped safely. Ayala took issue with the party's willingness to consign the Circle of the Black Sun to a gruesome death for their past actions which technically haven't killed a large number of people *yet*, and the party had a spirited philosophical discussion about the nature of responsibility and to what extent people of the Black Sun should suffer for their actions.

  In the end, the party decided to warn Dorcas to flee from the Nullwarden attack. They kept the messenger hawk so the Nullwardens wouldn't know if it survived to reach Gregory, giving him plausible deniability in case they ask him why he didn't help them in the attack. Dorcas took the news of the impending attack fairly well - after some initial sniping, he took the warning seriously and thanked the party for everything they had done. After some prodding from Ayala, he seemed to be seriously considering the motives of the people who had been guiding him, but didn't immediately come to any conclusions. He started rushing the Black Sun to pack up quickly and make haste, and told the party that they were welcome to take anything valuable that the group would be forced to leave behind due to excess weight. The party took some of what was left, along with a wall from one of their makeshift buildings. Charlie crafted the wall into a nice raft with enough room for everyone, and Ayala used her new connection to Lake Solace to guide the party on a safe and rapid journey across the lake toward their new destination: Whitefall, the small village where Ayala grew up. The party hoped that they would get some clarity on the current situation from Ayala's grandmother, a powerful naiad.

  On the other side of the lake, the party continued their travel through the mountains. Their travel was interrupted by a juvenile frost worm that burrowed up from the ground to attack them. Camilla's fire was particularly effective against it, and the party tactically arranged themselves to minimize the danger from its powerful frost breath. Although it tried to burrow through the party to reach Camilla, the party managed to keep it relatively boxed in to limit the danger, and they defeated it without serious injury.

  Join us this week for a peaceful visit to the lovely wilderness village of Whitefall!
