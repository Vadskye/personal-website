<h2>Investigations & Interrogations</h2>

<p>The party slowly trekked through the forest in search of the druidic enclave. Up ahead, they saw a pillar of smoke from a bonfire, and they ventured further to investigate. They found a small village where a mob of angry villagers was burning a middle-aged man and a small children's doll at the stake. When the party interrogated the villagers, they discovered that the man was being burned for having magical powers and for killing the local innkeeper, although there was no real evidence connecting him to the crime. Similarly, the doll was being burned for being suspicious and probably evil. The party was oddly unsatisifed with this explanation and negotiated with the mayor of the village to get the man and his doll taken off the bonfire in exchange for finding the true murderer. The man from the thanked the party and introduced himself as Charlie, a local toymaker and definitely not a murderer.

  Although the party was not entirely convinced that everything was on the level, they took Charlie and his doll around the village to investigate the real cause of the problems. They weren't reckless, of course - they kept his doll in tiny handcuffs that Camilla made. As they talked to various villagers and inspected the murder scene, the party determined that the exact circumstances of the murder were hard to pin down, but they became increasingly convinced of one thing: the doll was definitely evil. Some experimentation revealed that any damage to the doll also reflected itself on Charlie, which interfered with their plans to destroy the doll but only reinforced their determination that it was bad news. In the end, they decided to lock the doll in a box, lock that box in another box, and skip town with Charlie in search of more powerful magic-users who could break whatever strange and certainly terrible power bound the doll to him.

  Along their path towards the druidic village, the party was forced to rest the night deep in the woods. Unfortunately, a local band of goblins took advantage of Mikolash's unimpressive ability to be on watch and ambushed them in the night. The darkness and undergrowth made it difficult for the party to track them down as they were peppered with arrows, and brave Chort was nearly turned into a pincushion as he rushed into the woods after them. Charlie and Mikolash took cover in camp while Camilla and Ayala provided magical covering fire for Chort, and after an annoying battle full of Awareness checks the goblins were finally routed, allowing the party to continue sleeping.

  The next morning, the party continued their journey, and they finally reached the druidic village at a little after noon. After some initial confusion where the guards were convinced that they had been plant-touched, the party managed to convey their intentions and were promised a meeting with one of the druidic elders.

  Join us this week to discover what the druids know about the situation, and hopefully do something about Charlie and his weird doll!
