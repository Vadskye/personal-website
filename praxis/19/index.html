<h2>Pyramids & Pitfalls</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party painstakingly made their way across the last remnants of desert sand to reach the base of the pyramid. The pyramid's traps did their best to impede the party, with stairs converting into ramps and a door with many hidden pressure plates that released deadly attacks. However, Gregory caught Ayala as she fell down the ramp to prevent any injury, and Treecka bore the brunt of the door's attacks without any particular complaint, so the party managed to enter the pyramid base without serious risk.
</p>

<p>
  Inside the pyramid, the party found a small room with a staircase descending down into a door. They recognized that the stairs were trapped with pressure plates, so Ayala carefully bypassed the traps and slipped under the door as a puddle of water. Inside, she saw a squad of sand golems resembling ghouls and a pair of larger clay golems resembling otyughs. In addition, there were a group of large barrels apparently containing basic building resources: clay, sand, wood, and stone. The golems seemed not to pay her much attention when she was compressed into the form of a puddle, so she returned to the party to describe what she saw. With that knowledge, the party devised a clever plan.
</p>

<p>
  Ayala snuck back into the room and used her magic to trap one of the ghoulems in a water bubble. As the party expected, the ghoulems weren't smart enough to recognize that the attack came from the puddle of water, since Ayala was able to cast spells without any components. However, the otyugholems did appear to recognize the pulse of magic, and they stopped their activities to pursue her. She moved around the room trying to avoid their attacks while trapping the rest of the ghoulems.

  Treecka, Gregory, Chort, Simon, and Charlie tried to rush to Ayala's aid, but were blocked by the sturdy oak door. Camilla blasted the door with fire magic, and Charlie hit it with a telekinetic blast, causing the door to burst open. Unfortunately, Charlie's blast also triggered the pressure plates on the stairs. The stairs rotated around their central axis very rapidly in a way that was very complex and difficult to describe, flinging the three rescuers into the room and making it harder for Camilla and Mikolash to join them. With that, the battle was joined.
</p>

<p>
  The ghoulems in Ayala's water bubbles were fairly easy to dispatch, but the others managed to infect Simon and Chort with some sort of sand poison. Camilla wasted no time in jumping down to immediately get access to the room and send her flame serpents flying around through the goelms, but Mikolash was more tentative. He tried to make the best of his location at the top of the stairs for a while before eventually bubbling himself and jumping down to join the fight. Ayala was grabbed by an otyugholem that molded its tentacles into a sort of water scoop, but she was able to escape easily. She retreated into the corner of the room, and the rest of the party drew the golems' attention - especially Charlie and Diplo, who seemed to be experts at both golem dismemberment and totally avoiding any sort of damage from the golems. The party managed to clear out the ghoulems and were down to one otyugholem, but before they could finish it off, a squad of sand golems resembling tiny dragons flew up from the lower level. They joined the fight by blasting the party with tiny cones of sand. Simon took the brunt of several attacks and even suffered a vital wound, which was very scary. Fortunately, the party managed to blast through the rest of the golems before anything more dangerous happened - and before Simon and Chort succumbed to paralyzing sand that was running through their veins. In the aftermath of the fight, the party took a moment to reflect on their experiences and leveled up!
