<h2>Dragons & Dragons</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party charged into battle a pair of large red dragons and half a dozen smaller green dragons. Or rather, Gregory, Chort, Diplo, and a small army of various animals charged into battle, and the rest of the party stayed a respectable distance back from the main fight. The rangers and druids with the party scattered to use their ranged combat most effectively, leaving Gregory and Chort to bear the brunt of the dragons' assault. The green dragons landed to spit their short acid breath at the party in melee, while the red dragons swept overhead to rain fire on the party from above. Millie blasted both the red and green dragons with large swaths of fire, confusing the red dragons immensely. Mikolash realized that the dragons had a powerful flame aura that was magical in nature, so he magically crushed one of the red dragon's magic to block the aura and any other effects it might have foolishly tried to attune to before battle. Gregory and Chort made short work of the green dragons together, and one of the druids managed to magically smash a red dragon into the ground to give them more opportunities for melee smashing. Ayala did her usual debuff dance, attracting the ire of the other red dragon so it focused its full attention on her. While the rest of the party finished off the green dragons and red dragon, Ayala jetted around the forest trying to survive. She did a surprisingly good job of it, and the rest of the party was able to run to her aid after clearing the rest of the foes and they were able to kill the last dragon together.

  Unfortunately, "kill" is a bit misleading. Much to Ayala's disappointment, the dragons were not true dragons at all - they were summoned creatures, much like Treecka, Toph, Vena, and Suru. The party reasoned that they must have been created by the ritual they were travelling to, so they continued their journey after Mikolash healed Gregory - much to his surprise, given his resistance to magical healing. While they traveled, Whitefall contacted Chort with the magic circlet she gave him, and told him that Whitefall had defended itself from dragons but everything was under control because she was awesome. The rangers commented that they had heard of a dragon far larger than any dragon that the party or Whitefall had seen yet, and they hoped it wouldn't attack, especially not during the current game session. The next day, the party reached the edge of the high magic zone, and they took the opportunity to creatively augment their spells and attuned effects. With the living members of the party now dwarfed in size by the magical members, they continued into the high magic zone, and were greeted by a chill wind laced with the stench of death. In the air, they saw a Colossal white dragon accompanied by four black dragons. By all rights, a dragon that large should have been impossible for them to kill, but they placed their hopes in the augmented magic of the area.
