<h2>In the Hall of the Mountain King</h2>

<p>
  Two weeks ago, the party waited in the cave for the storm to end. Unfortunately, their rest did not last long, as a distant rumbling announced the presence of a new danger: frost giants. Brand was insufficiently stealthy<sup>1</sup> and attracted their attention to the party's cave. The giants tried to get in to attack the party, and when the cave's narrow confines made that impossible, they tried to seal the party in the cave to feast on their corpses after they starved. The party was almost concerned for a moment, but instead decided to intentionally cause an avalanche to kill or drive away the frost giants. With Ione's destructive magic and Craggles' rock-throwing, they triggered the massive amount of new snow delivered by the storm to form a deadly avalanche. As the party took cover in their cave, the frost giants were completely swept away.

  After the avalanche, the party waited for a time for their surroundings to be safe to travel again. They spent their time talking with Harruk and Vaktar, the dwarven patrol members they had encountered on the path, and the dwarves asked where exactly the party had come from and what they were doing on Mount Derenor. In the ensuing discussion, the party learned just how far removed they were from the world they had known. The current year was 5477AC<sup>2</sup>, which was hundreds or thousands of years later than the rest of the party had expected - and they were on Elysium, which most of the party had never heard of. In addition, when the party tried to explain what they had been doing, they were struck by a sudden attack of vomiting blood. Apparently, the warning from the Elder Sage that their souls were claimed by Demogorgon had been true. It was an enlightening<sup>3</sup> discussion, and the party resolved to visit the King of Undermountain to find out more about their new environment.

  When the storm abated, the party finally left the cave that had protected them and travelled down the path to reach the safety of the massive underground complex of Undermountain. Harruk and Vaktar led them to the throne room of King Garrun Ironforger, where they received an audience. They introduced himself to the king and attempted to explain their situation again, even resorting to taking their captive cultist out of the Bag of Holding. This was unsuccessful, and mostly just created a huge bloody mess all over the king's nice clean throme room, but he commended their effort. The King offered them all places to stay within the city and promised them the service of clerics to investigate their curse - as long as they completed an unspecified task in gratitude for his "charity". The party gratefully accepted, and travelled into town to rest in proper beds for the first time in many years. Whatever task the king had in mind, it couldn't be worse than their seven years spent as cultists...

  <li>This is technically an accurate description of what occurred.</li>
  <li>The date system is based on the number of years since Kahl created the mortal races; AC stands for "After Creation". That system is alien to people from Kilvas and other areas which were outside the time freeze; those people used a time system based on the number of years since the time freeze was created, though that was believed to be the date of Creation. That system uses a "C+" prefix, and the current date in that system would be rendered as C+2917.</li>
  <li>And long overdue, good heavens.</li>
