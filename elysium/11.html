<h2>Frosty the Throwman</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party continued continuing their trek up the mountain. As they walked over an oddly flat snowy plain, they realized that they were walking on a frozen lake - and below the thin layer of ice that supported them, something was swimming closer. They hurriedly concocted a plan to get off the ice involving flight and bags of holding<sup>1</sup>, and managed to avoid a fearsome dire shark<sup>2</sup> that apparently lived in the lake. Lester lured the shark to the surface with an illusion to ensure that the party had the opportunity to see the shark and properly appreciate that they were able to avoid it.

  With the lake behind them, the party continued their journey, drawing ever closer to the dragon's hoard. They found a pass between two hills that should lead them to their destination, but as they approached in the night, four frost giants emerged from hiding behind the hills and began pelting the party with massive thrown rocks. Cayosin stealthily ran closer to ambush the giants while the rest of the party heroically charged on their battle goats, with Craggles leading the way on his war ram<sup>3</sup>. Craggles tried to draw the giants' fire, since he was tough enough to barely care about the rocks as long as Ione kept healing him, while the rest of the party provided supporting fire<sup>4</sup>. Together, they killed one, whch broke the giants' morale and made them retreat. The party managed to stop two of them from retreating with the help of Lester's magical webs, but one managed to get away.

  After the fight, the party decided to retreat away from the hills to rest, knowing a winter storm was coming the next day. Join us this week to see what the frost giants were guarding...

  <li> Yes, again.</li>
  <li>A dire shark is like a regular shark, except that it's bigger and has a bunch of spikes that make it look scarier. The predatory and evolutionary value of the spikes is admittedly somewhat suspect.</li>
  <li> Because a battle ram sounds like something you'd use to knock down a castle's gate.</li>
  <li> In Brand's case, literally. In Lester's case, especially metaphorically.</li>
