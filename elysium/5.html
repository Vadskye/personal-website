<h2>Riddles Are Fun [citation needed]</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party vanquished the huge spider-like demon that stepped through the gate. Shanky was poisoned and badly wounded, but with Ione's help the party managed to keep him standing. After defeating the demon, the party realized that they had to avoid summoning something like that again<sup>1</sup>, and Cayosin and Lester the Jester agreed to compromise. Cayosin gave the miniature obelisk to Ione, and Lester cast his Comprehend Languages ritual on her, allowing her to read the writing on the base of the statue. Ione revealed that the writing contained two different riddles<sup>2</sup>, and the party set to work trying to solve them.

  At first, the party made good progress. After a few false starts, they quickly set up an arrangement of orbs that opened the gate to a seemingly identical room. However, through this portal, there were still guards just outside the room. The party left Bob Stonybrook and Durgos Bronzebeard behind with instructions to re-open the gate every hour, and passed through the gate to the new room.

  On the other side of the gate, the party determined that recreating the same pattern did not re-open the portal back to where they started, but it didn't summon a demon either. The guards were getting nervous, so Lester the Jester impersonated the voice of one of the Sages and began issuing them orders. The guards obeyed them without question, and the party soon received a wench, a poorly constructed winch, and books from the wizard's study. One of the books, "The Use and Construction of Artifacts", featured a familiar obelisk shape on the cover, which quickly caught the party's attention. According to the book, it was possible to construct an artifact called the Obelisk of Control. If properly constructed to its full size of several hundred feet tall, the obelisk could exert a powerful mind control effect on creatures within a massive area around it. The party went into the wizard's study themselves to investigate more thoroughly. They found two items of interest: a copy of the small obelisk statue, complete with identical writing on the bottom, and a scrap of paper in the same unknown language. Ione read the scrap of paper and found that it was a fragment of a journal entry, though it was of little immediate use<sup>3</sup>.

  After completing their investigation of the wizard's study, the party turned their attention to the gate once more. They spent the rest of the day trying various combinations and fighting various demons spawned by incorrect solutions, and made little progress<sup>4</sup>. Near the end of the day, as they were still puzzling over the solution, the gate unexpectedly opened and revealed two Sages on the other side. The Sages were surprised, and before they could close the portal, the party charged through after them...

  Tonight, the party will fight the Sages and hopefully solve the mystery of the Gate!

<li>This was, of course, doomed to fail. But at least they tried.</li>
<li>First riddle:
  <div style="margin-left: 0.5em">
    Eight Sages, bound in soul and purpose
    <br>
    We serve that Its will be done
    <br>
    Its Gates unite us in distant harmony
    <br>
    Two balance two in the path to the center
    <br>
    Mighty anchors above and below banish Its servants
  </div>
Second riddle:
  <div style="margin-left: 0.5em">
    The Obelisk of Demogorgon exerts our will
    <br>
    Build its fivefold form to find the core
    <br>
    From lowly base to highest peak
    <br>
    The Seventh Stone completes the path
  </div>
</li>
<li>Journal entry:
  <div style="margin-left: 0.5em">
    Our work on the obelisk nears completion. Its power defies imagination. We have worked so hard and long on it. What it will do when we turn it on is hard to imagine. We must keep them safe. Only the Elder Sage must know of their secrets.
  </div>

<li>Despite increasingly annoying reassurances that they almost had the solution, or had figured it out earlier and just needed to do it again but better this time.</li>
