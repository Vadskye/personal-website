<h2>I Roll For Exposition</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party was faced with their most physically imposing threat yet: the massive magma elemental deep within Mount Derenor. They resolved to face this problem by ignoring it, as usual. Thanks to Azoreus, the party knew the magma elemental had tremorsight1 and keen senses, but couldn't see through invisible things. To deal with that, Lester created a floating disk that the party could travel on and cast a spell to make everyone invisible and inaudible. The party then floated over the bridge invisibly, silently, and without touching the ground. Unsurprisingly, the magma elemental completely failed to notice them, and the party safely continued on down the tunnel.

  The rest of the journey proved uneventful, and the party finally made it back to Undermountain. After a brief stop to persuade a pair of dwarven guards to unlock the door and let them in, they made their way to King Garrun Ironforger. They were given an audience almost immediately, and began telling him the long-delayed story of their journeys now that they were free of Demogorgon's curse - starting seven years ago when they woke up as cultists in its service, and ending with the revelation of the three rituals.

  The king took the news gravely. He had deduced some of it from the partyâ€™s previous interactions, but the immediate threat of the rituals being only two and a half weeks2 from completion came as a surprise. He offered the aid of Undermountain in stopping one of the rituals, and the party discussed their optimal plan of attack. Eventually, they decided that the king would send his troops to the northern ritual in the Empire of the Sun. Most of the party would go to the ritual located in the Sunwake Mountains to the southwest and try to disable it themselves, while Cayosin and Ione would travel to the Shadowfall Mountains in the southwest to enlist the aid of their respective Orders and Elder Council of Dragons. With their course set, the party prepared travel the breadth of Elysium and stop the rituals that threatened the world...

  <li>Tremorsight allows creatures to "see" anything on contact with the ground using the vibrations of their passage. It's like Daredevil's vision, if he was hit by a radioactive rock to the head instead of drenched by radioactive industrial waste.</li>
  <li>To be precise, 12 days have passed since the party broke their mind control and Empress Regina died. That leaves 18 days until the rituals are complete, according to the timetable given by Regina the Flamespeaker.</li>
