<h2>Chilly Ghosts Gruff</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party continued their trek up the mountain. Warmed by their rings and cloaks, they survived the increasingly frigid air without difficulty. When they came to a narrow stone bridge that seemed to be the only way forward, they were momentarily stymied<sup>1</sup>, which gave Shanky the time to notice a group of frost trolls hiding below the bridge. The party reversed the ambush and attacked the trolls before they could react. They successfully dispatched the trolls, though one of them managed to body-slam Brand off a cliff before dying<sup>2</sup>. With the path clear, the party ferried across the gap on a floating platform from Lester.

  Farther up the mountain, the party reached their first major obstacle: a giant fort constructed by the Frost Folk to block a critical pass. After some deliberation, the party settled on a daring plan: Lester would make Cayosin and himself invisible, and the rest of the party would hide in a Bag of Holding. Then, Cayosin would fly Lester and himself over the fort while carrying the Bag of Holding. Despite some misgivings involving trusting Cayosin with the bag, the party went for it, and Cayosin sailed silently over the fort without incident. He released the party from the bag at a safe distance and they continued on their way.

  That night, the party went into a cave to rest safely. In the cave, they found a ancient skeleton which they pointedly ignored. However, in the middle of the night, a ghost emerged from the skeleton and demanded that the party take its bones out of the cave. The party tried to grab the bones and found that they were supernaturally cold to the touch, which prompted arguments about who should carry the bones outside. Shanky tried to get creative and shove the bones along with a rock, but accidentally bent one of the bones, which provoked the ghost into a brief burst of anger. The argument was finished when Cayosin mind-controlled Craggles to force her to take the bones out himself, which partially worked. The cold from the bones was no match for his sturdy barbarian frame, combined with Ione's healing magic. However, he regained his senses before he reached the end of the cave. Furious at Cayosin for taking over his mind, Craggles threw the bones at him, which damaged both Cayosin and the bones. This threw the ghost into a furious rage, and he manifested to attack the party. This threw the party into confusion; Craggles furiously attacked the ghost, Ione kept everyone alive through the ghost's brutal cold attacks, Lester, Shanky and Brand worked together to regather the scattered bones, and Cayosin watched it all happen. After some teamwork, the party gave all of the bones to Brand and he hurried outside. The ghost screamed at him to burn the bones, which Brand was uniquely well suited for. When he did, the ghost disappeared into thin air, and the party was left to finally get some sleep.
