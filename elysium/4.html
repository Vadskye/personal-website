<h2>Beneath the Pit of Soupiness</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party rested to recover after their battle with the Sages in the tunnels beneath the Pit. However, before they could finish their rest, they were interrupted by horrified screams coming from the eastern tunnel. They prepared for battle, and were surprised to see a group of cultist guards running in a panic past them and into the northern tunnel. One of them shouted an explanation: "We summoned a demon! Run!".

<p>
  The party was undaunted, and when the demon burst into the room, they attacked it. They managed to drive it back, but it escaped before they could kill it. With their resources now almost completely depleted, the party stayed in the room to rest overnight, and remained undisturbed that night. The next morning, they investigated the east tunnel that the demon came from. They found it in a strange room containing seven pedestals, eight colored orbs, a huge gate-like structure in the middle of the room, and an angry demon. Now flush with power after resting, they quickly dispatched the demon and began investigating the room. They determined that the orbs fit perfectly into indentations in the pedestals, but were unable to figure out any sort of logic or pattern, so they turned their attention to the northern tunnel.

<p>
  The northern tunnel contained a number of side rooms that the cultist guards slept in. At the end of the tunnel, the party found a wizard's study currently occupied by all of the guards who had fled from them earlier. There was a tense standoff for about twelve seconds before the guards surrendered without a fight. They offered the little information they knew freely, informing the party that there were two other Sages besides the five they had killed, and that the guards did not know the whereabouts of the other two Sages. They knew the room with the pedestals and orbs could be used as a gate to travel to other locations, but none of them knew how to activate it properly. When they tried to activate it improperly, they summoned the demon the party had killed.

  Armed with that information from the guards, the party searched the wizard's study for clues to the nature of the gate. Lester the Jester used his magical senses to identify the locations of three magic auras of interest. One came from a ring hidden in a drawer, one came from an incredibly detailed statue, and one came from a hidden compartment in the wall. Ione dispelled the statue, causing it to crumble into its individual limbs and become nonmagical<sup>1</sup>. Cayosin found the ring and opened the hidden wall compartment, revealing a small statue of an obelisk that seemed to be made of the same material as a large rock used in the ritual the Sages were performing. On the bottom of the statue, he found writing in an obscure language he didn't recognize. He asked Lester to grant him the ability to read the writing, but Lester refused to do it unless Cayosin gave him the ring. This disagreement proved completely impossible to resolve, so the party gave up, went back to the ritual room, and put the orbs in the pedestals in a random order. To no one's surpise, the gate rumbled and revealed a fiendish, unholy landscape, and from the gate stepped another huge demon...

<p>
  Tonight, the party will fight another demon and see if they can figure out how to work together as a semi-functional team!
