<h2>A Wild Lemure Appears</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party continued travelling down into the ominous misty crevasse. After more interminable hours of climbing, their progress was halted when they reached the surprisingly uneventful bottom. Suspicious, they started searching around and realized that the rock beneath their feet was actually an illusion of a floor combined with a magical barrier that prevented them from falling through<sup>1</sup>. Azoreas quickly made a small crevice in the side of the cavern so the party wouldn't have to stand precariously on the completely solid floor. As they prepared to destroy the floor to find out what lay beneath, an unexpected voice called out from the darkness and begged them not to do that.
</p>


<p>
  The party was not particularly persuaded by the voice, but they paused their plan of destruction long enough to talk with it and try to discern its true motives. It claimed to have been trapped in the cavern for years after trying to interfere with the ritual in the crevasse years ago. At the party's urging, it stepped out of the mists, revealing its grotesque shape. The creature had been cursed by the bearded devils, and was now reduced to a large, scarred lump of flesh. However, all was not as it seemed, and Aedan and Shanky realized with their acute vision<sup>2</sup> that the creature was concealed by an illusion, and was actually a slightly differently shaped lump of flesh. The deadly significance of this discovery became apparent when the creature recognized that the party had seen through its disguise and revealed its true form as an Dread Abyssal Lemure<sup>3</sup>.

<p>
  The party immediately went on the offensive while mostly staying in the safety of their crevice in the wall while their foe unleashed devastating magical spells at them with supernatural speed. The party could barely keep pace with its damage, especially since Taethorn was not as skilled at healing as Ione, and Shanky was forced to quickly retreat after delivering a series of incredibly rapid strikes. Aedan and Azoreas worked together to seal away the creature's fell magic, and when they completed their combo, the party was sheltered from its spells behind an invisible wall of antimagic. With that in its way, and reeling from the considerable damage the party had dealt, the creature mocked them and destroyed the floor it stood on, allowing it to fall safely away from the party to menace them another day. Fortunately, Lester caught the party in a magically conjured spider web to prevent them from falling to their deaths.

<p>
  Or at least, that was the plan. Instead, despite several members of the party being significantly bloodied, the majority of the party slipped away from Lester's web and jumped down into the hole in the floor to continue fighting the creature in midair<sup>4</sup>. It seemed taken aback, and had difficulty defending itself from the party's continued assault in midair. The chase was soon ended when the abyssal mage was impaled in a bed of force spikes that inexplicably appeared in midair beneath it. Fortunately, the party landed on illusory force pillows<sup>5</sup>, and they realized that it must have been Lester's doing.

<p>
  With the monstrosity defeated, the party rested and resumed their descent into the crevasse. After hours of climbing, and with the evening wearing on, they were surprised when a monstrous set of four ten-foot diameter tentacles appeared out of nowhere, grabbed Aedan, and dragged him down into the depths at supersonic speed. This week, they'll try to save him<sup>6</sup> and figure out what new horror awaits them...

  <li>This was, of course, nearly indistinguishable from an actual floor, except that was slightly smoother and much more expensive.</li>
  <li>More accurately, vision-like substitutes.</li>
  <li>A devil capable of wielding incredible arcane power. Not to be confused with a lemure, a grotesque lump of flesh that is completely useless in combat, or a lemur, an adorable lump of flesh that is completely useless in combat.</li>
  <li>Shanky took the much more reasonable approach of sprinting down the nearby wall, which had the advantage of not leaving him falling in freefall into the unknown abyss.</li>
  <li>Which, being made of force, were only slightly softer than the spikes.</li>
  <li>This will be easy, because he can simply teleport back to them with his magic boots, but they'll still get credit for trying.</li>
