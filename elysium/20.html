<h2>Ritual of Side Quest Summoning</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party continued their trek to reach the ritual site in the Sunwake Mountains. Along the way, they saw a pillar of smoke rising from up ahead of them. Shanky's magically augmented eyes allowed him to see its source: an unholy ritual to Theodolus that burned five great piles of corpses for some sinister purpose. After a prolonged discussion concerning the ethics and practicality of charging in to interrupt the ritual, the party decided to kill the cultists and interrupt their goals.

<p>
  With Lester's help, the party snuck up on the cultists and ambushed them. Shanky bravely charged into the front line with Craggles, but his roguish charm<sup>1</sup> was unable to protect him from a brutal assault that left him on the verge of death. Craggles threw him away from the fight and kept on smashing, aided by healing from Aedan, while the rest of the party stayed on the outskirts and blasted the cultists with ranged attacks.

<p>
  After a long and brutal fight, the party managed to incapacitate one of the head cultists and stop the ritual, but at the cost of channeling the misaimed power of the ritual into the other head cultist. Unfortunately, this granted him temporary superhuman powers, and the party rapidly fled from his augmented assault. They were able to outpace him, and when the effects of the botched ritual wore off they killed him without great difficulty. Without the head cultists, the remaining forces were no match for the party, and they dispatched them with ease. With the ritual interrupted, and Shanky on the mend, they resumed their journey...
