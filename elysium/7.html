<h2>Well, We're Underground Again</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party scurried down Mount Derenor, away from the cliff where the gate opened up. On their way down the path, they were greeted by a pair of heavily armed dwarves who seemed to be patrolling the path. The party assured the dwarves that they were not up to no good<sup>1</sup>, and the dwarves tentatively welcomed them to the outskirts of Undermountain, the wealth of tunnels and cities beneath the largest mountain in Creation. Before they could make it far down the path, however, the sky turned black and sinister with a sudden and improbable storm. As snow began to fall, lightning crackled through the sky, and the thunder angrily roared a name: "LESTER". The dwarves leading the party didn't seem to pick up on the name, but they recognized that the storm would stop them from reaching the tunnel into Undermountain, so they took refuge in a cave out in the wild.

  As the party entered the cave, they noted the existence of concerningly large, monstrous footprints. Once inside, they saw a deep pit at the end of the tunnel, which they stayed well back from while trying to keep the entrance to the cave open against the force of the storm so they could escape if necessary. Their caution proved useful when a horde of chokers<sup>2</sup> lept from the pit, angrily leaping at the party. However, the party fended them off with admirable skill thanks to good tactical positioning and a number of well-placed energy bursts. However, deeper in the pit, danger still beckoned, and two massive umber hulks<sup>3</sup> scaled the walls of the pit to attack the source of the noises. The party killed them before they could do any serious damage, but one of them grabbed Brand and threw him down into the pit. He escaped serious harm with the help of his new fire wings, and seemed to be talking with a dragon. The party started heading down the pit to meet the dragon, but before they could get down, Brand suddenly cried out in horror that he was under attack. The party descended much more rapidly, and found a massive tentacled creature in the middle of a pool of water, trying to pull Brand in. It retreated when faced with the party's full numbers, but not before warning them: "This mountain is mine." Undaunted, the party prepared to rest and wait out the storm.
