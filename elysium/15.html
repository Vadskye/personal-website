<h2>Fast Travel Sequence</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party decided conclusively not to betray the giants, and distributed the contents of the dragon hoard among themselves. While they were working on that, the giant guarding the door announced the arrival of an unexpected visitor to meet the party. Confused, they warily greeted the newcomer, a half-elf clad in winter travelling gear. He introduced himself as the Ranger Formerly Known as Steve<sup>1</sup>, and explained that he had been sent by the king of the dwarves to guide the party up to the Pillars of Infinite Light. They determined that he wasn't lying, and did indeed seem to have the ability to guide them, so they grudgingly allowed him to accompany them.

  When that task was completed, they spoke to Thorema, the king of the frost giants, and rested overnight. The next day, their appointed giant guides were ready and waiting for them. On their backs they wore complex contraptions seemingly designed to carry equipment across the mountain, but which were also well suited to carrying small frail mortals. They lept, flew, or were lifted onto the giants' backs and set off to reach the top of the mountain - or as close as the giants would take them.

  On their way up the mountain, the party was forced to rest overnight. They stayed on the giants as they slept. However, in the night, a sinister cracking emanated from the ice and snow beneath them. The party quickly woke up, but was unable to stop the mysterious creature from slicing open one of the giant's feet. The injury instantly froze solid, and was quickly followed by the rest of the giant, to the party's surprise and horror. The party quickly struck back, and in a short and brutal fight, they managed to drive the many-bladed snow creature back - but not before it ripped another giant to pieces.

  In the aftermath of the fight, Ione performed the most difficult feat of her healing career by resurrecting both of the dead giants. They were eternally grateful that the party had saved their lives, and pledged to tell their king of the party's generosity. One of them, Buured, was even inspired to dedicate the remainder of his second life to the worship of Bahamut in Ione's honor. The next morning, the giants took them the rest of the way up the mountain without further incident, stopping a mile from the peak. Beyond that point, they said it was dangerous, as indicated by a raging supernatural storm that began half a mile from the peak. The giants bid the party a fond farewell and went back down the mountain, leaving the party to fend for themselves. The Ranger Formerly Known as Steve led the way, though his unusual choice of paths led him and Cayosin to blows briefly. After settling the dispute, the party began the final stage of their journey.
