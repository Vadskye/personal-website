<h2>Ice to Meet You</h2>

<p>
  Last week, as the party rested overnight, they were interrupted by a pair of travellers outside. The travellers introduced themselves as Azoreus, an elven cleric, and Rousia, an elven sorcerer. They claimed that they had been sent by Gomer, the gnome merchant the party had dealt with in town, to help them transfer the dragon's hoard. Azoreus handed the party a strange bag and a note from Gomer, which explained that the bag was magically connected to another bag he had. Anything the party put into their bag would appear in his bag, and vice versa. He had originally intended to transfer the bag as part of the summoning stone he gave the party, but the bag can't be teleported without breaking, so he had to resort to physical delivery. The party was nonplussed, and immediately filled their bag with messages to Gomer asking for more explanation<sup>1</sup>. After some very pointed Sense Motive checks, they decided to trust the newcomers for the time being and resume their original plan of resting.

  The next morning, the sky was full of blinding snow as the storm gathered its strength. The party set off quickly to try to reach the hoard before the storm got worse. Along the way, they approached the same hills they fought the frost giants at last time, but the storm limited their ability to scout it out ahead of time. As they passed between the hills, there was an ominous rumbling, and an avalanche of snow and ice began tumbling down from each hill towards the party, threatening to bury and suffocate them all.

  This, however, was no great problem for the party, and they each reacted according to their nature. Cayosin and Ione took to the skies, with Ione quickly stuffing her goat into the Bag of Holding and Cayosin leaving his goat behind. Brand jumped off his goat, picked it up, and sprinted away from the avalanche with it, while the rest of the party generally scattered - except for Craggles. Craggles was not fast enough to escape, so he pulled out a beer and huddled his war ram under him to protect it. This heroic sacrifice<sup>2</sup> proved unnecessary when Rousia created a majestic dual wall of fire, which melted the avalanche right as it was crashing over him, removing all significant danger and replacing it with an annoying dampness. The appearance of the fire was so surprising that it prompted a giantish shout from on a hill.

  With the avalanche dealt with, the party turned their attention to dealing with the giants who caused it. They charged up the hills and dispatched a single pair of giants without great difficulty. With their path clear, they finally prepared to continue onward to the dragon's hoard...

 <li> Along with several less productive uses of magical teleporting notes.</li>
  <li>Sacrifice is not really the appropriate word, because Craggles was tougher by many standards than the stone he stood on and would have been fine, but the ram would have probably suffocated.</li>
