<h2>Let's Split Up and Search For Clues, Gang!</h2>

<p>
  Last week, the party split to go their separate ways for a time. Cayosin and Ione travelled to the southwest to request aid from the dragons to deal with the rituals, while the rest of the party began travelling southeast to stop the ritual taking place in the Sunwake Mountains. The dealings of Cayosin and Ione are deep and mysterious, and will be largely omitted except to note that they rolled at least one Persuasion check.

  The rest of the party began their trek by having a friendly gnome mage teleport them to Noreth, a town on the southeast end of Elysium. After arriving, they grudgingly bought horses after determining that walking 300 miles to their destination would be unpleasant. After riding for hours, they encountered a roving squad of hobgoblins. Fortunately, Lester saved them the minor inconvenience of brutally slaughtering them all by filling the closest mile of terrain with horrifying illusions, causing the hobgoblins to flee in terror. After that gruelling encounter, the party continued travelling for the rest of the day without incident.

  That night, their rest came to an abrupt halt when an even larger band of hobgoblins tried to sneak up on them in the night. However, before violence could erupt, Azoreas calmed their emotions to give the party time to react. Lester chose to react by delivering a hilarious pantomime performance that distracted the hobgoblins from their sinister aims long enough for Azoreas to complete a ritual that would allow him to understand them. With the ritual complete, and Lester’s performance having entirely won over the hobgoblins, the atmosphere transformed from a midnight ambush to midnight revelry. After further entertainment from the party, the hobgoblins put on a performance of their own, and after a time they left peacefully, allowing the party to finally get some rest.

  The next day, the party continued their journey, but were interrupted by an ominous rumbling coming from the ground beneath them. Lester created an illusion to distract the attention of whatever it was, and the party was therefore not dragged under the ground by a pair of magically augmented bulettes1. The creatures bore sigils of Theodolus, a powerful evil deity, and were immensely strong and durable. However, they were no match for the party’s coordinated assault. With the creatures defeated, the party continued their journey to reach the Sunwake Mountains before the ritual was complete...
